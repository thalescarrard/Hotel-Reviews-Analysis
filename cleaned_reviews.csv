Expedia.com,"I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with 3 ppl. Room was very spacious, kitchen (fully equipped) and bathroom were huge, Terrace was nice as well, washer/dryer were convenient. Bathtub wasn’t cleaned well initially and sofabed sucked, somewhat broken and not comfortable, definitely suitable for only 1 person. Onsite restaurant was delicious and you can get food sent up to your room or poolside. Beach was great but nowhere to get cocktails and you have to pay for umbrella and extra chair, 2 chairs and 2 towels are free. Pool area is nice but the cabanas were old and dusty with very limited poolside bar availability. Trolley and regular bus stop are a block away, there are 2 buses that take you to the airport in 40 minutes for $2.25. CVS and Walgreens nearby, staff were very nice and helpful when asked.",8.0,Nia,2024-07-27,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"Boulan South Beach er bedre enn sitt rykte, men ikke helt tilsvarende bildene som vises på hverken hotellets eller hotels.com sine sider. Størrelsen på rommene er bra. Vedlikeholdet er middels. Inntrykket man sitter igjen med er at rommene trenger en oppgradering. Det rengjøres, men det vedlikeholdes ikke. Alt i skapene manglet, blandebatteriet i dusjen var ødelagt, det er fuktskader i krokene og den ene platen på komfyren var defekt. Frokosten (maten) var super. Stemningen i frokostrestauranten var veldig vekslende. Samme gjelder for resepsjonen. Stor forskjell på de som jobber der. Et par var gode, resten var uinteresserte og til dels uhøflige. Beliggenheten er fin. Stranden fungerer fint, men vi ble sendt tilbake til hotellet etter håndkler, mens hotellet insisterte på at de skulle vi få på stranden. Poolen på taket er ok. Stemningen der oppe var så som så. De store rommene forsvarer nok prisen vi betalte, men alt i alt så vi mange hoteller vi nok heller velger neste gang. Det største problemet var stemningen. På ferie ønsker man en trivelig stemning, med smil og gode vibber. Det var det under 20% av de vi møtte på hotellet, i restauranten og på stranden som utviste. Øvrige anmeldelser jeg har lest, har vært enten topp score eller helt slakt. Vår virkelighet var noe midt i mellom. Hvis du ønsker god beliggenhet, ikke bryr deg om stemningen og setter pris på store rom, er Boulan Beach topp. Men, da må du se bort i fra manglende vedlikehold.",8.0,Verified traveler,2023-10-09,7.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Unfortunately, the hotel is really run down. The room was in need of a deep cleaning and repair.  Our sheets even had old makeup on them.

The pool area at first glance looked good, but it's also run down.  The jacuzzi didn't work and was very very dirty.

Expedia.com,I booked this hotel 2 months in advance for my birthday trip i arrived on Thursday and i was absolutely disappointed soon as i arrived inside the room i checked the bed and it was literally blood on the sheets … hair on the sheets … hair inside the shower on the walls … bugs on the towels that was already there n then when i asked to change the towels n sheets … the new set had baby spiders/ dead crabs on the towels … plus when housekeeping came in and change the sheets there was literally a whole long piece of hair on the new sheets n i told housekeeping what he decided to do was pick the hair up n throw it on the floor … now onto the floors i wore white socks i literally picked up my foot n it had nothing but dirt at the bottom the whole floor was dirty once again we asked house keeping to come clean the floors n clean out the shower but did they ? No they didn’t… the service was absolutely horrible … I’ve asked all the front desk people to speak to Emma which is supposedly the manager n all of them gave me different stories and times on when she was going to be there .. The staff attitudes especially Martina were absolutely horrible never again will i ever stay at this hotel ever again .. Also the air conditioning literally wasn’t working for 2 days … the refrigerator wasn’t getting cold so all the food we bought went bad drinks wasn’t getting cold nothing they finally fixed the air 2 days before we was leaving it was absolutely horrible … i still have yet to talk to Emma.,2.0,DaJah Ncole,2023-09-18,4.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"this hotel was recommended to me by a friend but i would absolutely not recommend it to anyone else. from the beginning, it was an annoyance. parking is around the corner, so you’re forced to pay $40 a day PLUS walk down at least 3 flights of steps and then completely around that to the opposite side of the building to enter the hotel. not to mention, when i walked up to the door i was greeted by Remy, the animal star from the movie Ratatouille.  
i was told there would be a bottle of wine for my boyfriends birthday, there was not. there was no phone menu for calling to the front desk. there was no menu in the room for the cost of items (the room is stocked with some snacks & alcohol). 
the shower head was old & broken so the water completely sprayed out at all angles and would spray out onto the bathroom floor unless the nozzle was directed at the wall, allowing only 50% of it to hit your body. also, the hot water does NOT last. 
outside of my room was a small fan that was being used to dry an enormous leak that soaked the entire hallway - no signs to alert you the floor was wet so my bags were wet on the bottom. 
there is no microwave or fridge in the room - the only fridge is tiny & pre-filled with room service items. as a destination in south beach, surrounded by restaurants, it’s so strange there is no way for guests to store leftovers. 
there is NO sound dampening so you will hear absolutely every person in your hallway as they enter & exit their rooms.

The main bathroom was nice

The half bath was redone but the faucet barely reached over the sink so when you use it water gets on the floor

The wine refrigerator did not work

One of the kitchen chairs was broken

The living room and kitchen was very outdated

Expedia.com,"Overall the hotel is not bad, but there were a lot of things that I think all hotels would consider unacceptable. I booked a Junior Terrace Suite and was “upgraded”, without any say as to why, to a room that I would not have chosen to stay in. Conditions of the room - a filthy couch in the living room area (and I do mean filthy as in THROW IT AWAY), all of the lights in the room need replacement because they are very dull, burn marks/holes in the curtains, two TV remotes and neither worked because the batteries were dead, TV also went out one night due to a storm (thanks DirecTV), shower head with a hose that leaks so bad that the water barely streams through it. They have a jacuzzi by the rooftop pool that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in years and a rooftop bar that they advertise but is no longer open according to an employee I asked - no drinks by the pool, and also that ocean view is not as close as it may seem in their photos.",6.0,Dezvon,2023-05-25,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"
Expedia.com,"I recently stayed for 3 nights and had an amazing experience. Because I arrived early I decided to eat at the restaurant while they got my room ready and the food was delicious. The staff were friendly and told me about all the amenities they offered. Quick walk to their private beach and garage parking right around the block. I originally was only staying for two nights and after I booked an extra night I was told that I would be moving into the 2 bedroom penthouse suite which was the best surprise! The room was insane and had an amazing view of the city and the ocean, I really couldn’t believe I was staying there for a night.

The hotel is very close to the ocean and restaurants, coffee shops, cvs, wallgreens, whole foods. We went to a few other places in the area (Viscaya Gardens, a boat tour, etc), and it was not a long drive to those places as well. The rooftop pool was good and clean too.

The only aspect that I was not happy about was parking. It is $40 per day (which is what they say on their website, so it was not a surprise to me), but the parking facility is very small, extremely dirty and smells like urine. I do understand that fixing the size of it is not possible, but they could at least ensure that it was clean (since that is the first impression people are getting when arriving to the hotel).",8.0,Tetyana,2023-06-23,4.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"NOT A 4 STAR HOTEL. TLDR: checking experience was infuriating.
I booked a suite for 3 adult guests. The 3 of us arrived at 11am and patiently waited. When we entered the room at 4pm, it was set for 2 guests only: 2 chairs, 2 towels, etc. We went to the reception to politely explain the situation but got scolded and treated with disrespect because ""they weren't supposed to know they should set the room for 3 people"". After an hour, nothing happened. I contacted Expedia. It took 3 hours and 5 agents for nothing. I explained over and over the situation. One finally contacted the receptionist who called me, argued again and hung up on me! After that, he went silent and refused to pick up the phone! The last chat agent gave me a phone number just to be told they will email the hotel and I'll get an answer in 24 hour. Where should we sleep during that time? Who knows. On top of that, that room was poorly made: table with cigarette burns, holes in walls, lamps without cord, and such... not even a 3 star hotel. We finally got linen for the sofa bed at 11pm. Sofa was broken, so we moved the mattress on the floor. There was no curtain so no way to sleep at all. In which world is this acceptable from a 4 star hotel?As an Expedia VIP member, I get a free upgrade when available, they had 3 available rooms. But this man decided to put us in a bad room and shove us away with contempt.The next morning another receptionist helped and moved us to an upgraded & better room, set for 3 guests.",4.0,faustine,2023-04-20,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"Great stay as a three in the suite with double sofa bed - rooms furnished to high standard, rooftop pool is very nice. The restaurant on ground floor does a good breakfast with a wide range of classic American breakfast and healthy options

Few issues to highlight:
1. Recommended parking by Boulan on same block is terrible - it costs $40 (standard rate on South Beach for valet parking), but you have to self park in tiny spaces and still leave keys with unfriendly parking staff, and no elevator to get to your floor; we moved our car to the municipal block by Collins Park (2minute walk) which was half the price, much bigger spaces, elevator to upper floors
2. We felt it quite stingy that the beach beds included with resort tax did not include umbrellas despite the risk of sunburn in mid-day sun - way to scrape an extra $20 out of your guests (we stayed in similar standard hotel in mid-beach the week before with free umbrellas)",10.0,Matthew,2023-04-20,2.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

She aggressively just kept telling us check in is guaranteed at 4pm and there is nothing she could do. Once we were finally able to get to into our room at 4pm and not a second sooner, we entered into a room that had a welcome sign with someone else’s name on it.

The hotel's location right in front of the beach was perfect; you could simply walk out and be on the beach. I want to express my thanks to Expedia and Boulan; they know what I mean. 
the rooms and the pool were fantastic.

Regarding cleanliness, I can't provide a conclusive opinion since we only stayed for a few days. On the first day, housekeeping knocked on our door at 9 AM, yes 9am...holidays..9am...offering their services. I declined, hoping they would return later, but for the next two days, there were no cleaning or towel changes. However, this is only a comment, and it's worth mentioning that the staff at the front desk were helpful. Overall, the hotel is totally recomendable.

Regarding parking, like many places in South Beach, it's a consideration. The hotel does not have parking, but there is a parking lot around the corner",10.0,Roberto,2023-07-31,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"What a terrible experience. The hotel was dirty, not just unkept lobby, the room was GROSS. We got a large 2 bedroom suite, not that any room should be dirty but this was one of the high end rooms.

Hair in the shower and bath drains, makeup and stains on the sheets and pillow cases, dust in any area that wasn't a table top. One of the dirty showers didn't have hot water.

The patio doors didn't lock, phone in the room didn't work, not that anyone at reception answered even when calling from our cell.

Handy man that came to look at the hot water and phone made a mess and didn't solve the issue, he came back at 11PM banging on the door.

Expedia.com,"Property Condition

The staff is great. However, the condition of the property needs to be addressed. The lobby is well maintained, but the rooms have not been given the same care. Mold was in the shower, and the toilet flushing mechanism was broken. The rooftop pool and hot tub are okay. The cabanas they have upstairs have filthy pillows (black and white, now dark brown and white), so I did not use them. The pool closed pretty early as well. 

Random Room Charges

Also, I didn't particularly appreciate that they charged for everything you touched in the room. Teabags, water, juice, etc., all cost well over MP. I would not recommend using their room items. There is a CVS around the corner; purchase from there instead.  

Parking

There is a 24-hour lot around the corner. The description says that there is parking at the hotel. However, that is false. The lot is not owned or operated by the hotel. There is a $40/day fee to park in the lot, and the parking timer is from 1:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. That is when you have to pay. If you come in after that time, you must pay $40. 

Convenience

Many Stores and restaurants are within walking distance of the hotel. Many restaurants are well overpriced, so be ready to spend $$$. There seems to be a restaurant service charge included at all restaurants in addition to a tip. read the receipt so that you do not unintentionally double-pay. Breakfast at one restaurant cost $180 for 2. The beach is a 3-minute walk.",6.0,Starr S,2024-04-25,4.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"Nice sized rooms and proximity to the beach was a plus but that’s where the good news ends. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere. Upon inspection the rooms were gross and in desperate need of attention. Caulk in the shower was molded and there was build up on the faucets. Ew. There was water damage on every door frame throughout the room and the ceiling in the master bath was peeling. The bathroom lock in our room was broken and it was obvious it had at some point been torn out of the wall. The hotel has no parking which is a significant inconvenience. The daily hotel service fee is honestly ridiculous and they should take the extra funds they get from this and apply it to much needed maintenance. We reserved a room that was supposed to have a pull out bed but instead had a normal couch. Although house keeping brought up a spare bed to remedy the issue, all it did was eliminate all floor space making the living room area unusable. There is no air conditioning in the hallways so it’s not only uncomfortable but it also gives the hallways a gross stagnant smell. Housekeeping did not vacuum one time during our stay or consistently provide towels or trash bags. The fire alarms went off twice at 5am during our stay, which according to the front desk is very common. I wanted a little more high-end/luxurious experience than we usually book and it was unfortunately a big disappointment.

Expedia.com,"I enjoyed the stay here for the most part.  However, 
- My original reservation was for the 1br PH, but when we arrived we were put into the 2br PH which had different views. 
Upon arrival, the room was not as clean as I would expect for the price paid. There were fingerprints/handprints on the bathroom mirrors. 
The first day the 2nd BR sheets smelled like Bengay 
The 2nd day there was foundation (makeup) on sheets in the 2nd BR and we do not wear any makeup. 
The freezer to the refrigerator did not work at all and the 2nd drawer in the refrigerator did not work. 
The A/C had a red light and service warning on the 2nd day.
The front desk wanted to charge $50/hr after the 1st hour to ride the bicycles. 
The Parking was TERRIBLE - website advertises that the hotel provides covered parking for $40/day, however when we arrived we were advised it was not hotel parking, but a 3rd party OR we could park outside the hotel in metered spots but would have to pay the meter every 3 hours (@ $12 for a total of $96/24 hrs). The parking deck was on the other side of the block and only gave you until 1pm for the $40/day instead of a full 24 hours. You had to walk up/downstairs to get to the parking floors and they had fresh urine from the workers in every corner which was disgusting and not worthy of $40/day or up to standard for a more upscale hotel.

Expedia.com,"Come descrivere Boulan? Sono stato cliente per anni ma ora c’è stato un crollo di qualità nonostante i prezzi elevati. Camere ormai logorate dal tempo, letti sfondati, servizio pessimo.
Cambiato tre camere, due materassi, telefoni mon funzionanti, risposta ai reclami inesistente se non per una receptionist molto brava (Martina) ma assolutamente impotente verso il declino di questo hotel.
Ultima camera venduta come studio King a 350 euro/notte che si rivela come un seminterrato con finestrelle bloccate, umidissimo e puzzolente di muffa. Mi chiedo come di possa definire questo hotel, eccellente. Per il costo che richiedono mi aspetto molto di più. Non tornerò di certo.

Expedia.com,"Sono, anzi ERO, un cliente del Boulan da diversi anni, ma sono rimasto estremamente deluso sia dall'hotel che dall'attendibilità delle informazioni del sito.
Ho cambiato tre camere. Una non aveva la tenda oscurante e visto che il sole sorge ad est esattamente dove era la finestra senza tenda, dormire era impossibile.
La seconda aveva il materasso sfondato ed alla richiesta di cambiare il materasso o renderlo più rigido ci hanno proposto di dormire su un materasso appoggiato al pavimento (cosa che abbiamo fatto)
La terza camera, per motivi di disponibilità ci è stata venduta come un King studio, rivelatosi una camera con finestre SIGILLATE, con una puzza di chuso che manco nella cantina del brunello, con umidità impossibile da far andare via.
Nonostante i reclami, non ci è stato proposto nemmeno un minimo di sconto per il disservizio. Non parliamo poi del servizio totalmente assente. Telefoni non funzionanti e nessuna risposta alle nostre richieste.
Ovviamente questo con dei prezzi per camera superiori a 330€ a notte.
Non mi vedranno mai più. Spero che possano chiudere come gli altri hotel della zona come il Delano, Il Bancroft, Il Sagamore. 
Ovviamente le condizioni dell'hotel sono ormai pessime, e l'età si fa sentire.",2.0,Paolo,2024-02-04,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"I landed early and came to drop off my bags. When I came back, they couldn’t find my bag so I had to go look and find it. Then they gave my room away to a different guest, and so the bellman had to run upstairs and get the key back from them. I ran a bath to relax and forget destress from check-in, but the water was lukewarm water. I showered after the bath, and still no hot water, only slightly warmer than lukewarm. 

When I picked my clothes off the ground after showering, they were covered in dust. The patio was large and spacious but the foliage around it was all dead and one of the chairs was broken. It was depressing so I kept the curtains closed. 

The couch in the living room was covered in stains (grossssss), and a big red wine stain on the rug. When I turned the tv on, both the living room and bedroom tv came on, cause they were back to back on the same wall. So I had to go back and forth to turn one of them off.

Overall, this was the absolute worst hotels I’ve stayed in for in the $250-300 night range.

The location was great, pool area was ok (cabanas are sad and worn out), but the patio dining of Orange Blossom the restaurant on site was the only good thing about this place.

Expedia.com,"I booked the last room available which was a 1 bedroom suite.  The room itself was huge and more like a very large apartment.  There were a few bugs inside the room which I didn't care for, but understood they could have come when the balcony door was open for a split second whilst I went out to check out the view.  If you want an early check in - ask beforehand.  I did not and arrived at 7am and could not check into the room until 2pm.  The staff on reception did their best to check me in earlier, but check out is 11am and I guess it takes them 3 hours to clean a room.  Great location and close proximity to the Miami Beach Convention Centre and the Beach is a few minutes walk.  Overall, a great place to stay for convenience, but the room could've been cleaner.  The bed for example is resting on a piece of MDF wood!  The vanity stool had blood on it.

None of these on their own would generally be a deal breaker but the presence of black mold in the bathroom presented not only an unsightly appearance but also a health hazard.

We were supposed to have complimentary late check out as per the VIP package (it was noted in our check correspondence from the hotel) and the front desk representative was rude and condescending with providing late check out. You pay more when more people are staying in the room, which is reasonable for the number of towels used etc, however they did not provide appropriate linens for 5 people (someone had to sleep on the pull out couch). Then when we called for them it the front desk attendant was clearly annoyed when taking the call and it took over 30 minutes to receive the linens. There was no need for attitude. There were 3 rubbish bins for the bathrooms but nothing for the kitchen making it difficult to keep things organized. The room itself is nice on the surface but it is not well kept - missing parts on the shower handles, sink handle pulling off the wall, one of the hotel phones didn’t work and the TV remote wasn’t working. The turn down service was passable. The benefit of this hotel is its location. The area is very walkable and it’s right by the Bass museum.

The string to pull the shade up was broken and the rooftop access was so filthy chairs were filthy and thrown around. No microwave. The tiles on the stairs were missing.. it needs to be closed for Renovations. I was so excited due to the pictures I seen online and I was surprising my boyfriend for his 50th birthday.. and it was so horrible.. when you think of penthouse you think fancy.. clean, big.. it was none of the above I would’ve preferred a regular room but those are probably just as bad.

In our last day about 10am we received a phone call stating we need to hurry up and leave. Check out us at 11 not 10. That staff and the person who checked us in needs to be fired.

Expedia.com,"J’ai le regret de vous faire part de mes doléances vécues lors de mon séjour à l’hôtel Boulan de Miami south beach.

 

-          Lors du check in nous avons été traité sans  aucun privilège gold, ni early check-in ni sur classement malgré  la disponibilité d’une chambre supérieure, donc nous avons dû attendre depuis 11h jusqu’à 16h pour avoir une chambre.

-          Lors du check-in la caution a été directement défalquée pour soit disant qu’elle soit remise après le départ et cela nous engendre une perte lors du change du dirham en dollars et vice versa alors qu’il pouvait se contenter de garder l’empreinte de la carte comme garantie à l’instar des autres hôtels.

-          A la réception des clés de la chambre nous avons été agressés verbalement par un technicien (Tony) qui se trouvait au comptoir de réception !!! et qui se prend pour le propriétaire de l’hôtel.

-          Après réception de la chambre à 21h30, et vu que la climatisation était à fond et qu’on ne pouvait pas la réglée,  j’avais demandé une couverture pour mon enfant et j’ai dû attendre jusqu’à 23h pour recevoir un drap sous prétexte que l’hôtel ne disposait pas de couvertures et par conséquent mon enfant s’est enrhumé.

-          Le lendemain j’ai pris un rendez-vous avec la manger à 11h pour faire une réclamation, cette dernière  m’a snobé jusqu’à 11h30 parce qu’elle parlait au téléphoneL.

-          Après le dépôt de ma réclamation le manager est resté très passif en me disant qu’elle allait remonter",4.0,LEILA,2022-08-30,1.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"The only good thing about this hotel is the location(a lot of walkable restaurants or stores to walk to) and second is the space that the penthouse has. It really needs an immediate update. My room smelled dirty when I went in and bed was dirty, curtains were dirty, walls too. They do not have onsite parking so that there is very inconvenient. The ugly public garage is in the back of the hotel. This hotel should be rated a 2.5 or 3 star. Especially not a 4 star. When it was once new I bet it looked super nice but not as of right now.

The roof top bar, pool and service was good but we had just come from somewhere with a larger pool and waiters wandering around to serve so personally we missed that element. We couldn't order food either from the pool/rooftop which was a shame. Otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

I know all hotels show only the best pictures but i expect the customer reviews to be honest and there is absolutely no way the average guest at this hotel considers it a 7.8/10 i would give it a 3/10.

There wasn't a closet, a bar to hang clothes or hangers.  I found the hotel nice some areas beautiful other areas requiring improvement.  It was weird going through halls and using service elevators to get to places like pool  or to the restaurant, if this is all due to renovations then I think for PR purposes it would be advertised as that. If it wasn't renovations being done, these areas need to be improved and made to feel safer.   I was single being on a business trip so felt uneasy in a few of these nooks. I did enjoy my stay and hotel had very nice crew working the front desk.

Expedia.com,"Pros: The staff were wonderful - kind and helpful. The rooms were large. The location is great, right by the beach and close to restaurants and shopping. 
Cons: We were on the 2nd floor and the trash room smell permeated the entire floor and was intense and nasty. It was impossible to walk to the elevator without holding your nose as the odor was so strong and awful. 
The room was not well equipped. It took several phone calls to get extra towels and blankets for the spare bed. It had a kitchen but nearly no plates or kitchen amenities like a dish towel or soap for the dishwasher. We could only get two beach towels for the beach and there was no way to rent or buy additional beach towels (we were a family of 4 and only 2 towels came with the room). Fine, but why can't we rent or buy 2 additional towels were for our two teenagers? Weird. 
The pool closed at 6 which was really early for such a gorgeous rooftop setting with beautiful views. 
The hot water was nearly non-existent. The hot tub at the pool was tepid. The hot water for a quick shower in our room ran out. The soaking tup in our room could only be filled with tepid water (you could not adjust the faucet any higher than luke warm). 
An air conditioner broke and leaked flooding our room. We had workmen (wonderful, kind people) in our room fixing it and cleaning up the mess for hours while we were in the room. 
We were designated VIPs (not sure why) but it was nowhere near any sort of VIP experience. It felt cheap.",4.0,Sarah,2022-12-27,,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"Great location, and very nice staff but the large ""suite"" seemed to basically be a very neglected Air BnB type apartment. Upon checking into the room it seemed off from the start. 

The hotel promotes these suites as partial ocean view but most just face the hotel directly across the street and the tree line blocks any view of the ocean. 

Floor to ceiling glass windows and door were filthy, large living room mirror was cracked & filthy. Sliding door was off track and even after we called down no one fixed it. 

Toilet seat was coming off the track and master bathroom toilet paper rack was missing altogether. 

The heat wasn't working and subsequently the thermostat stopped working altogether and this is during sub 40 degree days in Miami over Xmas. They troubleshooted this over multiple days and on the second day for hours with 3 techs in our suite while my wife and I were trying to relax, drink and eat before heading out for the night. Ended up replacing the entire thermostat.

Fridge went out so we moved everything to the freezer to make sure nothing spoiled while we were out. 

Apartment had automatic doors but the sensors were out of whack, opening randomly when no one was trying to go in and out. Came back from the store and the door was wide open. Finally had staff show us how to disable the door system by turning off the breaker. 

Shower handle was falling off so it was very hard to temperature control the shower. Nothing like scalding hot or freezing cold showers.",4.0,Gino,2023-01-06,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Expedia.com,"It was a very nice hotel and the staff was very nice and polite! My fiancé and I had a great time staying at the hotel. We didn’t like that right when we got to our penthouse and walked in there were just a bunch of door handles laying on the table for the glass sliding doors to our balcony so it was kind of a damper in our first exciting first reaction. There were some light switches in the penthouse that didn’t do anything and if they were suppose to, they didn’t. Then the main bathrooms toilet room light went out and we told the front desk that and they said they would have someone up and it looked like they messed with it but didn’t actually fix it yet. May have just been waiting for a new light. But those are small little things.

Expedia.com,"We stayed in 2 different rooms during our stay. First room was in the PH floor, very nice and clean room, second room did not meet out expectations (sofa broken, fixtures in the bathroom broken as well) but the front desk was able to immediately upgrade us to a one bedroom suite and this one definitely was what we expected. All the front staff were professionals. On both rooms, we were received with a bottle of wine. The breakfast was incredible, walking distance from the beach, shops and restaurants. We truly enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Only downfall is the parking. The hotel doesn’t offer a parking, there is a garage near by but be prepared to pay approximately $40 per day (I think), off-site parking is expensive too and you need to keep track of the time- to void a parking ticket. Other than the inconvenience we had with the second room, which was taken care immediately after showing pics, we had a great stay at this hotel.

Expedia.com,"This was a very cute and beautiful clean property. Everything was amazing except for the following: the hotel website states that they have a complimentary Golf cart to take you up to one mile away. However, this is not true. The Golf cart is only available if a certain employee is available, if it is not too busy and the employee himself stated that the golf cart is only to be taken to the beach which is is not a restriction listed at all on the website. 

Additionally, the expedia details state that there is on site parking.However, there is in fact not any onsite parking nor valet. You have to walk around the block to a parking garage that is very sketchy and shady, and the garage does not have any elevators, so you would need to drop off your bags at the hotel first, go park your car and then pay for parking and then come back to the hotel. The employees in the garage literally have on t shirts that say valet, but not a single person valets your car.

We had a one bedroom suite with a balcony, and the balcony has two doors to access it, one in the bedroom and one in the living room.However, you can only open the door from the living room.

The website states that the address to the hotel is 2000 Collins Avenue, however, that is not correct. The entrance to the hotel itself is actually 220 21st street. This is inconvenient because if you put in the address listed for the hotel, your Uber might end up in the wrong place and leave you.

Expedia.com,"I should've known something was amiss when I walked in because there were dirt stains on the walls and carpet, and the bathroom door had severe water damage. I had issues with one of the televisions on my first night, which a technician promptly came in and fixed, but it went downhill from there. The electricity kept going off in the room, resulting in frequent visits from the technician. I was advised to open the panel and reset the switch if the lights went out again. Why would I do this as a guest? I asked to be moved to another room, but I was told that the hotel was sold out, so this wasn't an option. The technician had to eventually remove some of the light bulbs from every room to keep the power on. When checking out, I asked for an incident report to be reimbursed for my stay as I prepaid via Expedia, and I was advised that I would receive a copy via email... I am still waiting for the email. Upon checking my bank statement a week later, I noticed that I was also charged the resort fee, which I was told at checkout that I wouldn't be!

Expedia.com,"The property was under construction and repair. The room we stayed in could have been really nice. But they put in an old torn up couch. The bed frame covering was peeling off. We kept running out of hot water. The hot tub next to the pool was out of order. There were no mattresses on the pool side beds. We were told that they were out for repair. None of this was communicated to us upon booking. I booked this hotel because the original hotel I booked was forth coming enough to let me know that the elevator was out of order. Someday, this will be a nice hotel, and I understand the need for revenue during renovation, but lower your price or offer one night free of charge for the inconvenience.

It has now been 22 days and I have tried numerous times to get $97 refunded to me from mini-bar hold and they will not respond except to say it will come off in 5-7 business days after checkout. Unacceptable. Tub was peeling, rotted wood on floor, patio furniture cracked and peeling, patio floor warped, door from Terrance to pool was broken, tv would not work in bedroom, wine cooler did not work, only a few cooking utensils, stovetop took forever to heat up, no hand towels were in room, no can opener, bathrobe had both waist/belt loops broken off, shower had water spitting out the side (broken/cracked) so you did not get full force of water, there was not a coffee maker in room as advertised (only an expresso maker).

The front desk staff was amazing was amazing, very friendly and helpful. The room we had was clean and beautiful, however, the balcony door was really difficult to use, the fan in the bedroom we couldn't get to work, when I called the front desk they didn't know how to turn it on so they were going to send maintenance up. The one thing I would suggest is to have a book in the room with sights to see in the area. I loved the full kitchen with dining room. The partial ocean view was a bit misleading. The restaurant Orange Blossom was fantastic food and great staff. The breakfast seemed very chaotic and unorganized, it was like night and day, there are a lot more people in the morning coming from the front door as well as the back end coming from hotel. It just seemed like they weren't ready for the amount of people that were there. People were ordering out of turn, forgetting who gets what, forgetting a drink.

Expedia.com,"Les installations communes sont plutôt agréables, la piscine en rooftop en particulier, même s'il faut noter que certains transats sont cassés. La situation est plutôt idéale bien qu'un peu éloignée d'Ocean Drive

Nous avons profité d'une suite ""appart hôtel vue partielle sur l'océan"" pour deux nuits. Nous avons été déçus de l'état général : tâches sur le canapé et sur le tapis, les bâtis de portes abîmés par l'humidité, les portes de placard plus que bancales, des angles des murs relativement abîmés par les coups, une serviette de toilette trouée le premier soir, portes à galandage de séparation entre la chambre et le séjour qui ne ferment pas, portes-fenêtres ne fermant pas non plus, store cassé et très abîmé dans la chambre (occultation quasi nulle), et pour finir environ la moitié des lumières ne fonctionnaient pas. 
La vue vaut plutôt le coup malgré tout, même si l'aménagement de la terrasse reste très sommaire. 

Pour finir, nous aimerions soulever la question du parking, qui vaut 40 $/nuit pour le parking partenaire le plus proche. Celui-ci vous permet de sortir et de rentrer autant de fois que vous le souhaitez dans la journée. 
Pour revenir au parking le plus proche (dans le même pâté de maisons que l'hôtel), celui-ci propose un service de voiturier, mais en tant que clients de l'hôtel, sachez que vous n'en avez pas  le droit. Sous quel prétexte ?

I was choosing carefully apartment as i knew that there are some rooms  not as per my family requirements. What i got ( and i took pictures to document) is smtng way below my expectations and price i paid.  This was really big disappoitment for me as someone who travel  frequently.

Do not get me wrong if i was alone it will be different. Some times  i didnt get what i was expexting but as i was alone i didnt make big problem about it. I need to be fair and to say that never before it was so bad. 
1. Room was way to small and way of from what i booked using pics from the site
2. Sofa was upside down so my kids were sleeping with their head down
3. Room was dirty , sheets were old etc
4. AC was working bad and it makes so big noise that we needed to switch on/off during the night as it outside temp was high

Booking.com,"location I forgave the hotel for torn bed sheets, filthy curtains and being locked out of our room at least twice during our 2 night stay. 

My biggest gripe was when my wife and 2 small kids got stuck in the hotel lift. They used the lift to go to the pool, the lift got stuck on level 5 (the same level as our room). The lift then went dark and was very hot with little air. All lift buttons didn’t work including the open button. My wife was terrified and the kids were crying and sweating. They used the local emergency button on the lift which activates an alarm bell but no one responded from the hotel. She then used the lift telephone to reach out to 911, after several attempts they picked the line and came to her rescue. During all this time (about 10-15ms) she was ringing the alarm bell and no one responded from the hotel.

When she exited the lift she explained what happened to me, I then reached out to the receptionist who said she knew nothing of the incident despite the fire department marching into the hotel! We also noted a cctv camera in the lift cabin but it was obvious no one was monitoring this. I asked to speak to the manager who is off duty, the manager could not make time to speak to me as I was informed she has an emergency. 

I left a message with reception and even reported the incident on email to the hotel, Disappointingly nobody responded to me.",1.0,Ahlam,2022-08-22,2.0,Family,7.1,481 reviews

Booking.com,"Pros
Spacious
Close to beach, great location 
Color scheme is nice
Restaurant was pretty
the pool area is nice and the view from the pool is beautiful. 
Definitely just needs some TLC and they need to fix this mold cat litter smell. Sliding door to balcony very very difficult to open even the handy person could barely open it.  they said they couldn’t fix until we left.
No trash can in bedroom
No mirror in bedroom
Bed sinking in middle
Couch ripped and sinking. Honestly felt like furniture was from a thrift store and not good quality… which is unacceptable when staying in a hotel. I didn’t feel like the couch was clean and wasn’t comfortable sitting on it.
There was just one  lamp in room not one on the other side table 
Crack in side table… it was made out of mirrored glass.
Light out in bathroom
Light out in kitchen 
Smells like a cat litter box, had to buy air freshener ourselves. My whole party went home and was sick for a few days. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s mold.
Could use a fresh paint job and touch up on gray walls.
Bathroom tissue holder fell off completely when we used it on arrival. 
Dust on side tables. 
 The balcony was just cement nothing special with no furniture to sit out there if I wanted to. all the junior suites with balconies are on the second level so you get a partial side walk view. I personally like being higher up but the 1 bedroom suite that’s higher up has a gorgeous bathroom
but the living space is smaller than the junior suite. 

$600 deposit for incidentals not told before hand (expected to pay something on south beach but that’s quite a lot for 4 days)

Pani w recepcji robiła z nas idiotów mówiąc że na pewno tyle ma. To nie jedyny przykład braku kompetencji personelu nigdy nie wiedzieli czy jest otwarty serwis plażowy ani nawet który to jest. Po kilka razy wracaliśmy się do hotelu przez braki informacyjne. Basen na dachu zamknięty z powodu huraganu - rano recepcja twierdzi że go nie otworzą przez kilka dni mimo slonecznej pogody a po godzinie otwierają. Ogólnie jedną z recepcjonistek na każde pytanie mówiła NO! A była najdłużej podczas naszego pobytu i nie pomogła w niczym. Nie polecam tego hotelu bo jest nie warty swojej ceny względem innych. Również booking nie pomógł przy tej rezerwacji na zgłaszany przezemnie problem nie odpowiadał przez tydzień więc rzetelność tego portalu też oceniam marnie.,1.0,Mario,2024-10-13,6.0,Family,7.1,481 reviews

TV has about 250 channels, but only a small number was supplied, the maintenance man said they only supply a basic package. Location was great - near the beach, restaurants & shopping. Bed king size & comfortable but no choice of pillows, all the same. Set menu Breakfast was delicious however drinks was either juice or tea of coffee, not both. On our 3 night stay the hotel took a $600US hold on our credit card - luckily we had sufficient funds to comply. MAJOR NEGATIVE is that after arriving home in Australia we checked our credit card and it took 3 days for the Hotel to release our $600 and they charged our card $8 without any notice, description or invoice. We used nothing from the mini-bar, coffee or bottled water, so I have disputed this charge with our credit card company and waiting for a response from the hotel.",6.0,Michael,2024-10-28,4.0,Couple,7.1,481 reviews

Booking.com,"The location of the property is good and the apartment is modern. Good kitchen facilities and CVS 24/7 hours just around the corner to avoid the expensive room service.
The cable TV offer is good. The hotel was unreachable for days (approx. 48 hours before arrival) both in writing and by telephone for me and the booking team. An inquiry as to whether the hotel was open at all was also not answered. When asked on site, they said it had been busy and they were sorry. The external parking facilities were poor, as the parking garage is multi-storey and has no elevator.
The shower was unfortunately a bit dirty but rinsing with water helped. The rest was overall very clean. 
Two beds were requested (1 king size + 1 sofa bed. Unfortunately there was only 1 blanket for both beds in the apartment. The reception even confirmed that two beds would be provided.

Booking.com,"Restaurant staff / pool staff were incredibly attentive and accommodating. Special shout out to Eva who always made us feel welcome and ensured we were comfortable.
Cleaning staff were friendly and efficient. Rooms were cleaned each day to a high standard with plenty of fresh bedding and towels. 
Location was great - close to bars, restaurants, clubs, beach, shops. The greatest issue I have with this property happened post-checkout. I returned home to see a $455 unexplained charge to my debit card. Following multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact the property via email and telephone, booking.com were able to confirm that the property had duplicately charged me for resort fees already paid in our settled cost to booking.com. Although booking.com have agreed to refund, I am yet to hear from the hotel. We were given a $0 invoice upon checkout and we were never informed of these charges or asked to pay (I’m unclear how the property obtained my card details). Communication has not been poor, it’s been nonexistent from the hotel on this matter.

Areas for improvement:
1. Members of reception were not always friendly or helpful. 
2. Breakfast vouchers were not printed when we checked in. When we asked for more (as included in price), reception were reluctant to provide.
3. Reception directed us to beach yoga but we arrived to find it had been cancelled. When we returned (5 minutes later) staff informed us of the cancellation. Perhaps it was cancelled in that time but if not we should have been informed. 
4. Golf cart was out of use each time we asked. 
5. Rooftop pool often lacked fresh towels.",6.0,Chloe,2024-09-04,8.0,Group,7.1,481 reviews
Booking.com,"Location was awesome. I mean we could walk to much of everything in south Beach. We would stay again for sure.

Literally a block. 

That wasn't the case, could definitely hear the ocean to be fair. Also they didn't do much of a good job cleaning the balcony. I know that's nip picking but when u book a balcony room you want to be able to feel like it was cleaned. 

When I say cleaned there wasn't trash left behind but you can tell they don't ""clean"" out there.

The sound insulation from both other rooms and the street is perfect; you rarely hear any noise from outside the room.

The breakfast is excellent, and the front desk staff is also amazing. After checking out, I was charged $84 USD, even though I didn't use anything from the mini bar. I called the hotel to ask about the bill, and they said they would investigate and get back to me. Several days went by, and when I tried to contact the hotel again, no one answered the phone. Eventually, the bill was refunded, but I'm still puzzled as to why I was initially charged. Also, it's frustrating that nobody is responding to my messages on Booking.com after I reported the issue.

I ordered a product and had it delivered by UPS to the hotel. However, when I checked in, the hotel couldn't locate the package and claimed they hadn't received it. After contacting UPS, they provided proof that the package was delivered to the front desk. UPS staff tried to help me call the hotel to locate the package, but they were unable to get through.

Booking.com,"The location is great, pretty close to the bars and restaurants area in South Beach, as well as the shops in Lincoln road. We had some issues when booking and staying in this hotel which made us decide not to come back here if we visit South Beach again:

1- During the booking, the hotel was hacked and sent us a very strange message asking for more money. After some stressful moments (we already paid for the stay) and with the help of Booking, we managed to clarify that there had been hacked (or that's what I would like to think).

2- We arrived a bit early, around 10:30 am. We then went out to visit some shops and waited for our room to be ready. When we came back at around 3:00 pm, the room was not ready yet. They made us wait 30 minutes in the reception until, after asking for the 4th time, suddenly they had the card and the room ready for check-in.

3- When we finally got into the room, it was not clean at all. There were some toilet paper and earsticks thrown around the bathroom, as well as some food rests on the sofa. This made me, for the first time in ages, come back to the reception to complain about the situation.

Booking.com,"The room was very clean, and housekeeping did a fabulous job. Great location. No communication from reception about facilities just pointed to a4 piece of paper. Or any communication would have been good. Not being told where towels were for the swimming pool. There is no info on the restaurant that we might have used if someone had spoken to us about and not just pointed to a a4 piece of paper. Room old & tired, sofa bed sagging, table cracked, dining chair about to break if a child sat on it. Cupboard door in kitvhen broken. Bed started to go as I met my husband in the middle.

Booking.com,"The location to stay in south is a good one. It is not crowded . The people working at the hotel were so rude. The maids, the people from the front desk.  The breakfast was bad and the people working there were so rude too 
The hotel charged me $77 from the coffee bar. We didn't consume anything and they charged a vodka, a coffee, some  detergent. That was 6 hrs after I did the check out.
I left the city , so since I received the message from my credit card about the charge, I started calling the hotel and nobody answered. Fortunately I had a friend near there and she went in person to dispute the charge,  at the same time I sent them an e mail and they decided to answer.
They refound most of the charges but not all, we don't know why!!
It was the  worst experience at a hotel in my life!  and most of the time I went to 3 star hotels.",1.0,Maria,2024-08-04,5.0,Family,7.1,481 reviews

Our reservation said all taxes and fees had been paid.
With the popularity of Air BNB and renting condos this hotel had too many restrictions.  For example, We give you two coffee pods, if you need more it is extra.  Breakfast offered coffee, tea or juice.  It felt very cheap.",5.0,Matt,2024-07-22,4.0,Couple,7.1,481 reviews

Spazzatura mai buttata. Sul terrazzino non c’era una luce funzionante, idem nel bagno l. Abbiamo chiamato più e più volte per sostituire la luce del bagno, collegare la tv, aggiustare la doccia. 
Un degrado così, é inammissibile. Ho chiesto aiuto in reception e la ragazza che si trovava lì in quel momento, anziché essere cordiale e trovare una soluzione, si é dimostrata spazientita e cafona, contrariamente dalla responsabile che é stata gentile e ha proposto un rimborso (che però ancora non ho visto né saputo a quanto ammonti).

Funcionários despreparados e grosseiros.
A cama extra para meu filho era um sofa cama impossível de  se dormir, pois o colchao era praticamente um filete e ainda tinha um ferro da estrutura do sofa que ficava no meio da coluna. Tivemos que colocar o colchão da cama no chão do quarto para ele dormir.
As toalhas estavam rasgadas e as roupas de cama muito manchadas.
Algumas lâmpadas do quarto queimadas e o toalheiro do banheiro quebrado.

Como chegamos muito tarde no hotel, preferimos deitar da forma que dava e tentar resolver os problemas no dia seguinte.

Ao amanhecer conversamos com um novo funcionario que estava na recepcao, que também não foi receptivo, mas nos pediu para voltarmos ao quarto que ele pediria para um funcionario ir até lá para olhar os pontos.
Ele nos deixou esperando no quarto por mais de 30 minutos e ninguém apareceu.

Es war die ganze Nacht Laut, da das Hotel direkt an der Strasse liegt. Leider waren die Betten der Kinder trotz buchung bei der ankunft nicht bereit und wurden erst später bereitgestellt. Sehr enttäuschend war, dass der Pool auf dem Rooftop geschlossen war. Dies wurde uns nicht mitgeteilt bei der Ankunft und war für unsere Buchhung wichtig, da wir zwei Kinder haben. somit war die Freude getrübt. Das Personal war sehr unfreundlich, uns wurde keine Rückersattung geamcht sonder wir wurden aufgefordert der Managerin eine Mail zu schreiben. Diese wurde nich beantwortet.
