booking,Amazing location and massive room. Staff rude upon check out when asking question about return of safety deposit. When also asked for late check out was advised we would have to pay extortionate money for somewhere to shower and get changed.,8.0,Kane,2024-09-28,3.0,Group,7.1,481 reviews

booking,"Restaurant staff / pool staff were incredibly attentive and accommodating. Special shout out to Eva who always made us feel welcome and ensured we were comfortable.
Cleaning staff were friendly and efficient. Rooms were cleaned each day to a high standard with plenty of fresh bedding and towels. 
Location was great - close to bars, restaurants, clubs, beach, shops. The greatest issue I have with this property happened post-checkout. I returned home to see a $455 unexplained charge to my debit card. Following multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact the property via email and telephone, booking.com were able to confirm that the property had duplicately charged me for resort fees already paid in our settled cost to booking.com. Although booking.com have agreed to refund, I am yet to hear from the hotel. We were given a $0 invoice upon checkout and we were never informed of these charges or asked to pay (I’m unclear how the property obtained my card details). Communication has not been poor, it’s been nonexistent from the hotel on this matter.

Areas for improvement:
1. Members of reception were not always friendly or helpful. 
2. Breakfast vouchers were not printed when we checked in. When we asked for more (as included in price), reception were reluctant to provide.
3. Reception directed us to beach yoga but we arrived to find it had been cancelled. When we returned (5 minutes later) staff informed us of the cancellation. Perhaps it was cancelled in that time but if not we should have been informed. 
4. Golf cart was out of use each time we asked. 
5. Rooftop pool often lacked fresh towels.",6.0,Chloe,2024-09-04,8.0,Group,7.1,481 reviews

booking,"Location was awesome. I mean we could walk to much of everything in south Beach. We would stay again for sure. I'm a big balcony person so I was under the impression when I booked a ""oceanfront"" room my room would be able to see the ocean even with it being 1 block away from the beach..... Literally a block. 

That wasn't the case, could definitely hear the ocean to be fair. Also they didn't do much of a good job cleaning the balcony. I know that's nip picking but when u book a balcony room you want to be able to feel like it was cleaned. 

When I say cleaned there wasn't trash left behind but you can tell they don't ""clean"" out there. 


Kinda like picking up all the dirty towels, restocking the tissue and making sure no trash is in the bathroom... Did they actually clean it? Nope.",8.0,Tyriek,2024-09-03,3.0,Family,7.1,481 reviews

booking,"Room - we booked the biggest room with balcony and it was like a one bedroom apartment with cooking facilities. Furniture on balcony damaged. Handles missing from at least three drawers in kitchen & bathroom. You had to pay for coffee pods after the first 2 free and no free bottled water supplied (so we didn’t use anything from the fridge or the 2 free coffee pods). TV has about 250 channels, but only a small number was supplied, the maintenance man said they only supply a basic package. Location was great - near the beach, restaurants & shopping. Bed king size & comfortable but no choice of pillows, all the same. Set menu Breakfast was delicious however drinks was either juice or tea of coffee, not both. On our 3 night stay the hotel took a $600US hold on our credit card - luckily we had sufficient funds to comply. MAJOR NEGATIVE is that after arriving home in Australia we checked our credit card and it took 3 days for the Hotel to release our $600 and they charged our card $8 without any notice, description or invoice. We used nothing from the mini-bar, coffee or bottled water, so I have disputed this charge with our credit card company and waiting for a response from the hotel.",6.0,Michael,2024-10-28,4.0,Couple,7.1,481 reviews
booking,"The location of the property is good and the apartment is modern. Good kitchen facilities and CVS 24/7 hours just around the corner to avoid the expensive room service.
The cable TV offer is good. The hotel was unreachable for days (approx. 48 hours before arrival) both in writing and by telephone for me and the booking team. An inquiry as to whether the hotel was open at all was also not answered. When asked on site, they said it had been busy and they were sorry. The external parking facilities were poor, as the parking garage is multi-storey and has no elevator.
The shower was unfortunately a bit dirty but rinsing with water helped. The rest was overall very clean. 
Two beds were requested (1 king size + 1 sofa bed. Unfortunately there was only 1 blanket for both beds in the apartment. The reception even confirmed that two beds would be provided.

booking,"The location is great, pretty close to the bars and restaurants area in South Beach, as well as the shops in Lincoln road. We had some issues when booking and staying in this hotel which made us decide not to come back here if we visit South Beach again:

1- During the booking, the hotel was hacked and sent us a very strange message asking for more money. After some stressful moments (we already paid for the stay) and with the help of Booking, we managed to clarify that there had been hacked (or that's what I would like to think).

2- We arrived a bit early, around 10:30 am. We then went out to visit some shops and waited for our room to be ready. When we came back at around 3:00 pm, the room was not ready yet. They made us wait 30 minutes in the reception until, after asking for the 4th time, suddenly they had the card and the room ready for check-in.

3- When we finally got into the room, it was not clean at all. There were some toilet paper and earsticks thrown around the bathroom, as well as some food rests on the sofa. This made me, for the first time in ages, come back to the reception to complain about the situation.

Furthermore, the people at the reception were a bit rude. They were not friendly and we had to deal with asking two or three times certain stuff.",4.0,Jose,2023-12-11,1.0,Couple,7.1,481 reviews

Nothing was like on the picture + everything was exceptionally broken: toilet was clogged, sliding doors were broken, one door with lock had a torn hole instead of proper key hole.

Kitchen was stocked poorly and for 2 people...Towels just for 2 people, not comfort tough beds. Terrace worth another sentence- if you book terrace it means all up floors stuff may fall on you. As well as conditioner leaking on your head. We got a big condensate stagnation on our terrace.with all of that reception never pick up a phone so we have to go to ask for something...

Spacious
Close to beach, great location 
Color scheme is nice
Restaurant was pretty
the pool area is nice and the view from the pool is beautiful. 
Definitely just needs some TLC and they need to fix this mold cat litter smell. Sliding door to balcony very very difficult to open even the handy person could barely open it.  they said they couldn’t fix until we left.
No trash can in bedroom
No mirror in bedroom
Bed sinking in middle
Couch ripped and sinking. Honestly felt like furniture was from a thrift store and not good quality… which is unacceptable when staying in a hotel. I didn’t feel like the couch was clean and wasn’t comfortable sitting on it.
There was just one  lamp in room not one on the other side table 
Crack in side table… it was made out of mirrored glass.
Light out in bathroom
Light out in kitchen 
Smells like a cat litter box, had to buy air freshener ourselves. My whole party went home and was sick for a few days. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s mold.
Could use a fresh paint job and touch up on gray walls.
Bathroom tissue holder fell off completely when we used it on arrival. 
Dust on side tables. 
 The balcony was just cement nothing special with no furniture to sit out there if I wanted to. all the junior suites with balconies are on the second level so you get a partial side walk view. I personally like being higher up but the 1 bedroom suite that’s higher up has a gorgeous bathroom
but the living space is smaller than the junior suite.

booking,"location I forgave the hotel for torn bed sheets, filthy curtains and being locked out of our room at least twice during our 2 night stay. 

My biggest gripe was when my wife and 2 small kids got stuck in the hotel lift. They used the lift to go to the pool, the lift got stuck on level 5 (the same level as our room). The lift then went dark and was very hot with little air. All lift buttons didn’t work including the open button. My wife was terrified and the kids were crying and sweating. They used the local emergency button on the lift which activates an alarm bell but no one responded from the hotel. She then used the lift telephone to reach out to 911, after several attempts they picked the line and came to her rescue. During all this time (about 10-15ms) she was ringing the alarm bell and no one responded from the hotel.

When she exited the lift she explained what happened to me, I then reached out to the receptionist who said she knew nothing of the incident despite the fire department marching into the hotel! We also noted a cctv camera in the lift cabin but it was obvious no one was monitoring this. I asked to speak to the manager who is off duty, the manager could not make time to speak to me as I was informed she has an emergency. 

I left a message with reception and even reported the incident on email to the hotel, Disappointingly nobody responded to me.",1.0,Ahlam,2022-08-22,2.0,Family,7.1,481 reviews

Do not get me wrong if i was alone it will be different. Some times  i didnt get what i was expexting but as i was alone i didnt make big problem about it. I need to be fair and to say that never before it was so bad.

I don’t know if the water quality is checked regularly and for sure they need to clean the pool every morning before the first guests are coming.

Basen na dachu zamknięty z powodu huraganu - rano recepcja twierdzi że go nie otworzą przez kilka dni mimo slonecznej pogody a po godzinie otwierają.

Funcionários despreparados e grosseiros.
A cama extra para meu filho era um sofa cama impossível de  se dormir, pois o colchao era praticamente um filete e ainda tinha um ferro da estrutura do sofa que ficava no meio da coluna. Tivemos que colocar o colchão da cama no chão do quarto para ele dormir.
As toalhas estavam rasgadas e as roupas de cama muito manchadas.
Algumas lâmpadas do quarto queimadas e o toalheiro do banheiro quebrado.

Como chegamos muito tarde no hotel, preferimos deitar da forma que dava e tentar resolver os problemas no dia seguinte.

Ao amanhecer conversamos com um novo funcionario que estava na recepcao, que também não foi receptivo, mas nos pediu para voltarmos ao quarto que ele pediria para um funcionario ir até lá para olhar os pontos.
Ele nos deixou esperando no quarto por mais de 30 minutos e ninguém apareceu.
Voltamos na recepcao falando que estávamos no aguardo e que ninguém apareceu, então iriamos tomar o cafe da manha e retornávamos na recepcao. 
Ao retornarmos na recepcao ele ligou para supervisora do hotel, que foi muito rápida e gentil, tentando resolver todos os pontos acima imediatamente. localização",6.0,Anonymous,2023-02-16,2.0,Couple,7.1,481 reviews

booking,"The room was beautifully decorated with a stunning view from both the room and the rooftop pool. It even features a Marshall speaker that allows travelers to relax in the room. The sound insulation from both other rooms and the street is perfect; you rarely hear any noise from outside the room.

The breakfast is excellent, and the front desk staff is also amazing. After checking out, I was charged $84 USD, even though I didn't use anything from the mini bar. I called the hotel to ask about the bill, and they said they would investigate and get back to me. Several days went by, and when I tried to contact the hotel again, no one answered the phone. Eventually, the bill was refunded, but I'm still puzzled as to why I was initially charged. Also, it's frustrating that nobody is responding to my messages on Booking.com after I reported the issue.

I ordered a product and had it delivered by UPS to the hotel. However, when I checked in, the hotel couldn't locate the package and claimed they hadn't received it. After contacting UPS, they provided proof that the package was delivered to the front desk. UPS staff tried to help me call the hotel to locate the package, but they were unable to get through. It's frustrating that no one at the hotel is answering the phone.",8.0,Li-kuang,2024-07-01,5.0,Group,7.1,481 reviews

No bedding for the sofa bed, only 2 sets of glasses and mugs in the cupboard, and amenities included in the room tax were only available for 2 people eg. Sun loungers at the beach.

booking,"The location was good, 20 minutes walk away from the shopping street on the south direction, the hotel room was very big with two restrooms. I was really impressed with the size of the room. The kitchen was modern, however the pans were scratched and I did not used them. The street that the room window was facing, was very noisy for at least 3 days. People were shouting, and we could here trucks beeping in the middle of the night. The bed was big but not comfortable at all, the mattress was compressed with body weight, and head would remain on higher position than the body. I woke up with body ache a couple of time. The room service was very good, they offered it everyday. The rooftop pool was good, I was expecting a bigger and fancier pool area based on the hotel photos, the Jacuzzi was under construction and we could not use it. The restaurant was expensive, Doordashing was a better option for us.",7.0,N,2023-11-07,6.0,Family,7.1,481 reviews

My room smelled dirty when I went in and bed was dirty, curtains were dirty, walls too. They do not have onsite parking so that there is very inconvenient. The ugly public garage is in the back of the hotel. This hotel should be rated a 2.5 or 3 star. Especially not a 4 star. When it was once new I bet it looked super nice but not as of right now.

None of this was communicated to us upon booking. I booked this hotel because the original hotel I booked was forth coming enough to let me know that the elevator was out of order.

expedia,"I should've known something was amiss when I walked in because there were dirt stains on the walls and carpet, and the bathroom door had severe water damage. I had issues with one of the televisions on my first night, which a technician promptly came in and fixed, but it went downhill from there. The electricity kept going off in the room, resulting in frequent visits from the technician. I was advised to open the panel and reset the switch if the lights went out again. Why would I do this as a guest? I asked to be moved to another room, but I was told that the hotel was sold out, so this wasn't an option. The technician had to eventually remove some of the light bulbs from every room to keep the power on. When checking out, I asked for an incident report to be reimbursed for my stay as I prepaid via Expedia, and I was advised that I would receive a copy via email... I am still waiting for the email. Upon checking my bank statement a week later, I noticed that I was also charged the resort fee, which I was told at checkout that I wouldn't be!

expedia,"This was a very cute and beautiful clean property. Everything was amazing except for the following: the hotel website states that they have a complimentary Golf cart to take you up to one mile away. However, this is not true. The Golf cart is only available if a certain employee is available, if it is not too busy and the employee himself stated that the golf cart is only to be taken to the beach which is is not a restriction listed at all on the website. 

Additionally, the expedia details state that there is on site parking.However, there is in fact not any onsite parking nor valet. You have to walk around the block to a parking garage that is very sketchy and shady, and the garage does not have any elevators, so you would need to drop off your bags at the hotel first, go park your car and then pay for parking and then come back to the hotel. The employees in the garage literally have on t shirts that say valet, but not a single person valets your car.

We had a one bedroom suite with a balcony, and the balcony has two doors to access it, one in the bedroom and one in the living room.However, you can only open the door from the living room.

The website states that the address to the hotel is 2000 Collins Avenue, however, that is not correct. The entrance to the hotel itself is actually 220 21st street. This is inconvenient because if you put in the address listed for the hotel, your Uber might end up in the wrong place and leave you.

The one thing I would suggest is to have a book in the room with sights to see in the area. I loved the full kitchen with dining room. The partial ocean view was a bit misleading. The restaurant Orange Blossom was fantastic food and great staff. The breakfast seemed very chaotic and unorganized, it was like night and day, there are a lot more people in the morning coming from the front door as well as the back end coming from hotel. It just seemed like they weren't ready for the amount of people that were there. People were ordering out of turn, forgetting who gets what, forgetting a drink.

Nous avons profité d'une suite ""appart hôtel vue partielle sur l'océan"" pour deux nuits. Nous avons été déçus de l'état général : tâches sur le canapé et sur le tapis, les bâtis de portes abîmés par l'humidité, les portes de placard plus que bancales, des angles des murs relativement abîmés par les coups, une serviette de toilette trouée le premier soir, portes à galandage de séparation entre la chambre et le séjour qui ne ferment pas, portes-fenêtres ne fermant pas non plus, store cassé et très abîmé dans la chambre (occultation quasi nulle), et pour finir environ la moitié des lumières ne fonctionnaient pas. 
La vue vaut plutôt le coup malgré tout, même si l'aménagement de la terrasse reste très sommaire. 

Pour finir, nous aimerions soulever la question du parking, qui vaut 40 $/nuit pour le parking partenaire le plus proche. Celui-ci vous permet de sortir et de rentrer autant de fois que vous le souhaitez dans la journée. 
Pour revenir au parking le plus proche (dans le même pâté de maisons que l'hôtel), celui-ci propose un service de voiturier, mais en tant que clients de l'hôtel, sachez que vous n'en avez pas  le droit. Sous quel prétexte ?

The bathroom lock in our room was broken and it was obvious it had at some point been torn out of the wall. The hotel has no parking which is a significant inconvenience. The daily hotel service fee is honestly ridiculous and they should take the extra funds they get from this and apply it to much needed maintenance. We reserved a room that was supposed to have a pull out bed but instead had a normal couch. Although house keeping brought up a spare bed to remedy the issue, all it did was eliminate all floor space making the living room area unusable. There is no air conditioning in the hallways so it’s not only uncomfortable but it also gives the hallways a gross stagnant smell. Housekeeping did not vacuum one time during our stay or consistently provide towels or trash bags. The fire alarms went off twice at 5am during our stay, which according to the front desk is very common. I wanted a little more high-end/luxurious experience than we usually book and it was unfortunately a big disappointment.

expedia,"Property Condition

The staff is great. However, the condition of the property needs to be addressed. The lobby is well maintained, but the rooms have not been given the same care. Mold was in the shower, and the toilet flushing mechanism was broken. The rooftop pool and hot tub are okay. The cabanas they have upstairs have filthy pillows (black and white, now dark brown and white), so I did not use them. The pool closed pretty early as well. 

Random Room Charges

Also, I didn't particularly appreciate that they charged for everything you touched in the room. Teabags, water, juice, etc., all cost well over MP. I would not recommend using their room items. There is a CVS around the corner; purchase from there instead.  

Parking

There is a 24-hour lot around the corner. The description says that there is parking at the hotel. However, that is false. The lot is not owned or operated by the hotel. There is a $40/day fee to park in the lot, and the parking timer is from 1:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. That is when you have to pay. If you come in after that time, you must pay $40. 

Convenience

Many Stores and restaurants are within walking distance of the hotel. Many restaurants are well overpriced, so be ready to spend $$$. There seems to be a restaurant service charge included at all restaurants in addition to a tip. read the receipt so that you do not unintentionally double-pay. Breakfast at one restaurant cost $180 for 2. The beach is a 3-minute walk.",6.0,Starr S,2024-04-25,4.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

The cleanliness was questionable, with lots of dust and filthy baseboards, peeling paint on the ceiling of the bathroom, and stained bathroom floors.

None of these on their own would generally be a deal breaker but the presence of black mold in the bathroom presented not only an unsightly appearance but also a health hazard.

Unfortunately, despite the expansive rooftop pool area , the gorgeous outdoor dining area, and the pleasant accommodating staff, the Boulan lacked the attention to detail and, in particular, the cleanliness  of many of its South Beach competitors and thus cannot be recommended.",4.0,Nicholas,2024-04-16,1.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

expedia,"I booked the last room available which was a 1 bedroom suite.  The room itself was huge and more like a very large apartment.  There were a few bugs inside the room which I didn't care for, but understood they could have come when the balcony door was open for a split second whilst I went out to check out the view.  If you want an early check in - ask beforehand.  I did not and arrived at 7am and could not check into the room until 2pm.  The staff on reception did their best to check me in earlier, but check out is 11am and I guess it takes them 3 hours to clean a room.  Great location and close proximity to the Miami Beach Convention Centre and the Beach is a few minutes walk.  Overall, a great place to stay for convenience, but the room could've been cleaner.  The bed for example is resting on a piece of MDF wood!  The vanity stool had blood on it.

expedia,"Sono, anzi ERO, un cliente del Boulan da diversi anni, ma sono rimasto estremamente deluso sia dall'hotel che dall'attendibilità delle informazioni del sito.
Ho cambiato tre camere. Una non aveva la tenda oscurante e visto che il sole sorge ad est esattamente dove era la finestra senza tenda, dormire era impossibile.
La seconda aveva il materasso sfondato ed alla richiesta di cambiare il materasso o renderlo più rigido ci hanno proposto di dormire su un materasso appoggiato al pavimento (cosa che abbiamo fatto)
La terza camera, per motivi di disponibilità ci è stata venduta come un King studio, rivelatosi una camera con finestre SIGILLATE, con una puzza di chuso che manco nella cantina del brunello, con umidità impossibile da far andare via.
Nonostante i reclami, non ci è stato proposto nemmeno un minimo di sconto per il disservizio. Non parliamo poi del servizio totalmente assente. Telefoni non funzionanti e nessuna risposta alle nostre richieste.

expedia,"The staff was overall unhelpful and rude. Seemingly reasonable requests were all problems. We were supposed to have complimentary late check out as per the VIP package (it was noted in our check correspondence from the hotel) and the front desk representative was rude and condescending with providing late check out. You pay more when more people are staying in the room, which is reasonable for the number of towels used etc, however they did not provide appropriate linens for 5 people (someone had to sleep on the pull out couch). Then when we called for them it the front desk attendant was clearly annoyed when taking the call and it took over 30 minutes to receive the linens. There was no need for attitude. There were 3 rubbish bins for the bathrooms but nothing for the kitchen making it difficult to keep things organized. The room itself is nice on the surface but it is not well kept - missing parts on the shower handles, sink handle pulling off the wall, one of the hotel phones didn’t work and the TV remote wasn’t working. The turn down service was passable. The benefit of this hotel is its location. The area is very walkable and it’s right by the Bass museum. If the staff were trained to provide better service, basically service with a more pleasant and helpful attitude, it would have been a much better experience.",4.0,Danielle,2024-03-10,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Ficamos em um dos melhores aposentos . Penthouse 4 ( cobertura). A água fria do chuveiro não funcionava ( banho escaldante ); cortina fina sem o forro blackout ( acordávamos ao nascer do sol, com a claridade); as máquinas de lavar e secar , quebradas ( sem poder usar) .
Tudo foi reclamado e com pedido p arrumarem , sem sucesso. Pagamos o equivalente a 3.700 dólares por 5 noites . Devido ao total desconforto saímos do Boulan depois da 4’ noite, pagamos 5 e não usamos uma diária . Pedimos reembolso o q também nos foi negado . Moral da história Boulan e sua gestão são incompetentes, agem de uma forma soberba, desrespeitosa para c o seus hóspedes . O q poderia ter sido uma excelente estadia se tornou desconfortável pá dizer o mínimo. Ah, fora a sujeira da sacada do quarto , banheiro . Nossa viagem de férias acabou sendo um pesadelo.

expedia,"I enjoyed the stay here for the most part.  However, 
- My original reservation was for the 1br PH, but when we arrived we were put into the 2br PH which had different views. 
Upon arrival, the room was not as clean as I would expect for the price paid. There were fingerprints/handprints on the bathroom mirrors. 
The first day the 2nd BR sheets smelled like Bengay 
The 2nd day there was foundation (makeup) on sheets in the 2nd BR and we do not wear any makeup. 
The freezer to the refrigerator did not work at all and the 2nd drawer in the refrigerator did not work. 
The A/C had a red light and service warning on the 2nd day.
The front desk wanted to charge $50/hr after the 1st hour to ride the bicycles. 
The Parking was TERRIBLE - website advertises that the hotel provides covered parking for $40/day, however when we arrived we were advised it was not hotel parking, but a 3rd party OR we could park outside the hotel in metered spots but would have to pay the meter every 3 hours (@ $12 for a total of $96/24 hrs). The parking deck was on the other side of the block and only gave you until 1pm for the $40/day instead of a full 24 hours. You had to walk up/downstairs to get to the parking floors and they had fresh urine from the workers in every corner which was disgusting and not worthy of $40/day or up to standard for a more upscale hotel.

expedia,"I landed early and came to drop off my bags. When I came back, they couldn’t find my bag so I had to go look and find it. Then they gave my room away to a different guest, and so the bellman had to run upstairs and get the key back from them. I ran a bath to relax and forget destress from check-in, but the water was lukewarm water. I showered after the bath, and still no hot water, only slightly warmer than lukewarm. 

When I picked my clothes off the ground after showering, they were covered in dust. The patio was large and spacious but the foliage around it was all dead and one of the chairs was broken. It was depressing so I kept the curtains closed. 

The couch in the living room was covered in stains (grossssss), and a big red wine stain on the rug. When I turned the tv on, both the living room and bedroom tv came on, cause they were back to back on the same wall. So I had to go back and forth to turn one of them off.

Overall, this was the absolute worst hotels I’ve stayed in for in the $250-300 night range.

The location was great, pool area was ok (cabanas are sad and worn out), but the patio dining of Orange Blossom the restaurant on site was the only good thing about this place.

Hair in the shower and bath drains, makeup and stains on the sheets and pillow cases, dust in any area that wasn't a table top. One of the dirty showers didn't have hot water.

The patio doors didn't lock, phone in the room didn't work, not that anyone at reception answered even when calling from our cell.

Handy man that came to look at the hot water and phone made a mess and didn't solve the issue, he came back at 11PM banging on the door.

expedia,"this hotel was recommended to me by a friend but i would absolutely not recommend it to anyone else. from the beginning, it was an annoyance. parking is around the corner, so you’re forced to pay $40 a day PLUS walk down at least 3 flights of steps and then completely around that to the opposite side of the building to enter the hotel. not to mention, when i walked up to the door i was greeted by Remy, the animal star from the movie Ratatouille.  
i was told there would be a bottle of wine for my boyfriends birthday, there was not. there was no phone menu for calling to the front desk. there was no menu in the room for the cost of items (the room is stocked with some snacks & alcohol). 
the shower head was old & broken so the water completely sprayed out at all angles and would spray out onto the bathroom floor unless the nozzle was directed at the wall, allowing only 50% of it to hit your body. also, the hot water does NOT last. 
outside of my room was a small fan that was being used to dry an enormous leak that soaked the entire hallway - no signs to alert you the floor was wet so my bags were wet on the bottom. 
there is no microwave or fridge in the room - the only fridge is tiny & pre-filled with room service items. as a destination in south beach, surrounded by restaurants, it’s so strange there is no way for guests to store leftovers. 
there is NO sound dampening so you will hear absolutely every person in your hallway as they enter & exit their rooms.

The room was perfect, quiet, comfortable, with every amenity imaginable. it would make the perfect home base for a longer stay in Miami Beach, and we will definitely put it at the top of our list for an eventual return trip.",10.0,Matias,2023-10-26,,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

expedia,"Boulan South Beach er bedre enn sitt rykte, men ikke helt tilsvarende bildene som vises på hverken hotellets eller hotels.com sine sider. Størrelsen på rommene er bra. Vedlikeholdet er middels. Inntrykket man sitter igjen med er at rommene trenger en oppgradering. Det rengjøres, men det vedlikeholdes ikke. Alt i skapene manglet, blandebatteriet i dusjen var ødelagt, det er fuktskader i krokene og den ene platen på komfyren var defekt. Frokosten (maten) var super. Stemningen i frokostrestauranten var veldig vekslende. Samme gjelder for resepsjonen. Stor forskjell på de som jobber der. Et par var gode, resten var uinteresserte og til dels uhøflige. Beliggenheten er fin. Stranden fungerer fint, men vi ble sendt tilbake til hotellet etter håndkler, mens hotellet insisterte på at de skulle vi få på stranden. Poolen på taket er ok. Stemningen der oppe var så som så. De store rommene forsvarer nok prisen vi betalte, men alt i alt så vi mange hoteller vi nok heller velger neste gang. Det største problemet var stemningen. På ferie ønsker man en trivelig stemning, med smil og gode vibber. Det var det under 20% av de vi møtte på hotellet, i restauranten og på stranden som utviste. Øvrige anmeldelser jeg har lest, har vært enten topp score eller helt slakt. Vår virkelighet var noe midt i mellom. Hvis du ønsker god beliggenhet, ikke bryr deg om stemningen og setter pris på store rom, er Boulan Beach topp. Men, da må du se bort i fra manglende vedlikehold.",8.0,Verified traveler,2023-10-09,7.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

No they didn’t… the service was absolutely horrible … I’ve asked all the front desk people to speak to Emma which is supposedly the manager n all of them gave me different stories and times on when she was going to be there .. The staff attitudes especially Martina were absolutely horrible never again will i ever stay at this hotel ever again .. Also the air conditioning literally wasn’t working for 2 days … the refrigerator wasn’t getting cold so all the food we bought went bad drinks wasn’t getting cold nothing they finally fixed the air 2 days before we was leaving it was absolutely horrible … i still have yet to talk to Emma.,2.0,DaJah Ncole,2023-09-18,4.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

It had chipping all over but it was fine. The staff was fine not friendly but not extremely rude.

The hotel's location right in front of the beach was perfect; you could simply walk out and be on the beach. I want to express my thanks to Expedia and Boulan; they know what I mean. 
the rooms and the pool were fantastic.

Regarding cleanliness, I can't provide a conclusive opinion since we only stayed for a few days. On the first day, housekeeping knocked on our door at 9 AM, yes 9am...holidays..9am...offering their services. I declined, hoping they would return later, but for the next two days, there were no cleaning or towel changes. However, this is only a comment, and it's worth mentioning that the staff at the front desk were helpful. Overall, the hotel is totally recomendable.

Regarding parking, like many places in South Beach, it's a consideration. The hotel does not have parking, but there is a parking lot around the corner",10.0,Roberto,2023-07-31,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

expedia,"The front desk staff need to be retrained on what good hospitality looks like. Their tone and demeanor come off very rude. The way they treat you makes you never want to go back again. We arrived at the hotel at 12pm and we were already aware that check in is guaranteed by 4pm but the young front desk lady did not want to make any effort in trying to get us in our room earlier. A simple phone call could have been made to house keeping to just ask if our room could be done any sooner than 4pm since we were the only ones there waiting to check in. She aggressively just kept telling us check in is guaranteed at 4pm and there is nothing she could do. Once we were finally able to get to into our room at 4pm and not a second sooner, we entered into a room that had a welcome sign with someone else’s name on it. When we notified the front desk they said to just ignore it when clearly they had a mix up. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone that plans on trying to check in before 4pm.",4.0,Fredon,2023-07-04,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

expedia,"Our overall stay was good. The hotel is a bit old (furniture, etc.) but it is clean. All staff were very polite and friendly; there was an every-day service in the room. The hotel is very close to the ocean and restaurants, coffee shops, cvs, wallgreens, whole foods. We went to a few other places in the area (Viscaya Gardens, a boat tour, etc), and it was not a long drive to those places as well. The rooftop pool was good and clean too.

The only aspect that I was not happy about was parking. It is $40 per day (which is what they say on their website, so it was not a surprise to me), but the parking facility is very small, extremely dirty and smells like urine. I do understand that fixing the size of it is not possible, but they could at least ensure that it was clean (since that is the first impression people are getting when arriving to the hotel).",8.0,Tetyana,2023-06-23,4.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

Conditions of the room - a filthy couch in the living room area (and I do mean filthy as in THROW IT AWAY), all of the lights in the room need replacement because they are very dull, burn marks/holes in the curtains, two TV remotes and neither worked because the batteries were dead, TV also went out one night due to a storm (thanks DirecTV), shower head with a hose that leaks so bad that the water barely streams through it. They have a jacuzzi by the rooftop pool that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in years and a rooftop bar that they advertise but is no longer open according to an employee I asked - no drinks by the pool, and also that ocean view is not as close as it may seem in their photos.",6.0,Dezvon,2023-05-25,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

The half bath was redone but the faucet barely reached over the sink so when you use it water gets on the floor

The wine refrigerator did not work

One of the kitchen chairs was broken

The living room and kitchen was very outdated

Few issues to highlight:
1. Recommended parking by Boulan on same block is terrible - it costs $40 (standard rate on South Beach for valet parking), but you have to self park in tiny spaces and still leave keys with unfriendly parking staff, and no elevator to get to your floor; we moved our car to the municipal block by Collins Park (2minute walk) which was half the price, much bigger spaces, elevator to upper floors
2. We felt it quite stingy that the beach beds included with resort tax did not include umbrellas despite the risk of sunburn in mid-day sun - way to scrape an extra $20 out of your guests (we stayed in similar standard hotel in mid-beach the week before with free umbrellas)",10.0,Matthew,2023-04-20,2.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

expedia,"NOT A 4 STAR HOTEL. TLDR: checking experience was infuriating.
I booked a suite for 3 adult guests. The 3 of us arrived at 11am and patiently waited. When we entered the room at 4pm, it was set for 2 guests only: 2 chairs, 2 towels, etc. We went to the reception to politely explain the situation but got scolded and treated with disrespect because ""they weren't supposed to know they should set the room for 3 people"". After an hour, nothing happened. I contacted Expedia. It took 3 hours and 5 agents for nothing. I explained over and over the situation. One finally contacted the receptionist who called me, argued again and hung up on me! After that, he went silent and refused to pick up the phone! The last chat agent gave me a phone number just to be told they will email the hotel and I'll get an answer in 24 hour. Where should we sleep during that time? Who knows. On top of that, that room was poorly made: table with cigarette burns, holes in walls, lamps without cord, and such... not even a 3 star hotel. We finally got linen for the sofa bed at 11pm. Sofa was broken, so we moved the mattress on the floor. There was no curtain so no way to sleep at all. In which world is this acceptable from a 4 star hotel?As an Expedia VIP member, I get a free upgrade when available, they had 3 available rooms. But this man decided to put us in a bad room and shove us away with contempt.The next morning another receptionist helped and moved us to an upgraded & better room, set for 3 guests.",4.0,faustine,2023-04-20,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

expedia,"We stayed in a 2-bedroom suite and it was fantastic! Clean, plenty of room for our party of 6 (all adults)! Hanging out on the balcony was great, one block from the beach, close to a lot of restaurants and bars…. It was GREAT. There’s a CVS on the corner, too, which was convenient. The pool was beautiful but definitely had some areas that could use a little “sprucing up”, like the hot tub area, and the pool bar was pretty beat up, but honestly it didn’t bother us. We would definitely stay here again. We ate at Orange Blossom for dinner one night and for breakfast the next day. The service there is very, very slow. Wait staff is kind of inattentive, but could just be that there isn’t enough staff. The food was enjoyable though.",10.0,Jeanne,2023-02-23,2.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The hallway always smells a little when you walk out of any room and feels very muggy.

We had a great stay except for a few incidences with staff. We called ahead of time for a rollaway bed, and it took 4 trips down to the lobby to remind staff to send it up.

expedia,"Great location, and very nice staff but the large ""suite"" seemed to basically be a very neglected Air BnB type apartment. Upon checking into the room it seemed off from the start. 

The hotel promotes these suites as partial ocean view but most just face the hotel directly across the street and the tree line blocks any view of the ocean. 

Floor to ceiling glass windows and door were filthy, large living room mirror was cracked & filthy. Sliding door was off track and even after we called down no one fixed it. 

Toilet seat was coming off the track and master bathroom toilet paper rack was missing altogether. 

The heat wasn't working and subsequently the thermostat stopped working altogether and this is during sub 40 degree days in Miami over Xmas. They troubleshooted this over multiple days and on the second day for hours with 3 techs in our suite while my wife and I were trying to relax, drink and eat before heading out for the night. Ended up replacing the entire thermostat.

Fridge went out so we moved everything to the freezer to make sure nothing spoiled while we were out. 

Apartment had automatic doors but the sensors were out of whack, opening randomly when no one was trying to go in and out. Came back from the store and the door was wide open. Finally had staff show us how to disable the door system by turning off the breaker. 

Shower handle was falling off so it was very hard to temperature control the shower. Nothing like scalding hot or freezing cold showers.",4.0,Gino,2023-01-06,3.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

expedia,"Pros: The staff were wonderful - kind and helpful. The rooms were large. The location is great, right by the beach and close to restaurants and shopping. 
Cons: We were on the 2nd floor and the trash room smell permeated the entire floor and was intense and nasty. It was impossible to walk to the elevator without holding your nose as the odor was so strong and awful. 
The room was not well equipped. It took several phone calls to get extra towels and blankets for the spare bed. It had a kitchen but nearly no plates or kitchen amenities like a dish towel or soap for the dishwasher. We could only get two beach towels for the beach and there was no way to rent or buy additional beach towels (we were a family of 4 and only 2 towels came with the room). Fine, but why can't we rent or buy 2 additional towels were for our two teenagers? Weird. 
The pool closed at 6 which was really early for such a gorgeous rooftop setting with beautiful views. 
The hot water was nearly non-existent. The hot tub at the pool was tepid. The hot water for a quick shower in our room ran out. The soaking tup in our room could only be filled with tepid water (you could not adjust the faucet any higher than luke warm). 
An air conditioner broke and leaked flooding our room. We had workmen (wonderful, kind people) in our room fixing it and cleaning up the mess for hours while we were in the room. 
We were designated VIPs (not sure why) but it was nowhere near any sort of VIP experience. It felt cheap.",4.0,Sarah,2022-12-27,,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

A pesar de haber pagado la tarifa de un día más, me exigían hacer el check-out a las 11:00, porque no registraron correctamente ni recordaban mi solicitud.

First room was in the PH floor, very nice and clean room, second room did not meet out expectations (sofa broken, fixtures in the bathroom broken as well) but the front desk was able to immediately upgrade us to a one bedroom suite and this one definitely was what we expected. All the front staff were professionals. On both rooms, we were received with a bottle of wine. The breakfast was incredible, walking distance from the beach, shops and restaurants. We truly enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Only downfall is the parking. The hotel doesn’t offer a parking, there is a garage near by but be prepared to pay approximately $40 per day (I think), off-site parking is expensive too and you need to keep track of the time- to void a parking ticket. Other than the inconvenience we had with the second room, which was taken care immediately after showing pics, we had a great stay at this hotel.

We didn’t like that right when we got to our penthouse and walked in there were just a bunch of door handles laying on the table for the glass sliding doors to our balcony so it was kind of a damper in our first exciting first reaction. There were some light switches in the penthouse that didn’t do anything and if they were suppose to, they didn’t. Then the main bathrooms toilet room light went out and we told the front desk that and they said they would have someone up and it looked like they messed with it but didn’t actually fix it yet. May have just been waiting for a new light. But those are small little things.

There wasn't a closet, a bar to hang clothes or hangers.  I found the hotel nice some areas beautiful other areas requiring improvement.  It was weird going through halls and using service elevators to get to places like pool  or to the restaurant, if this is all due to renovations then I think for PR purposes it would be advertised as that. If it wasn't renovations being done, these areas need to be improved and made to feel safer.   I was single being on a business trip so felt uneasy in a few of these nooks. I did enjoy my stay and hotel had very nice crew working the front desk.   There also wasn't any information on hotel services i.e. pool times, restaurant connected to hotel, park across the street, TV channels available.

The lobby smelled, the elevator smelled and the room smelled. It looks like it was a beautiful hotel when new but now it is a run down dump. It just feels gross and looks dirty.
I walked in to the room and was embarrassed to be there, i immediately sat down on the couch, which had a large stain, and got a different hotel. I know all hotels show only the best pictures but i expect the customer reviews to be honest and there is absolutely no way the average guest at this hotel considers it a 7.8/10 i would give it a 3/10.

expedia,"J’ai le regret de vous faire part de mes doléances vécues lors de mon séjour à l’hôtel Boulan de Miami south beach.

 

-          Lors du check in nous avons été traité sans  aucun privilège gold, ni early check-in ni sur classement malgré  la disponibilité d’une chambre supérieure, donc nous avons dû attendre depuis 11h jusqu’à 16h pour avoir une chambre.

-          Lors du check-in la caution a été directement défalquée pour soit disant qu’elle soit remise après le départ et cela nous engendre une perte lors du change du dirham en dollars et vice versa alors qu’il pouvait se contenter de garder l’empreinte de la carte comme garantie à l’instar des autres hôtels.

-          A la réception des clés de la chambre nous avons été agressés verbalement par un technicien (Tony) qui se trouvait au comptoir de réception !!! et qui se prend pour le propriétaire de l’hôtel.

-          Après réception de la chambre à 21h30, et vu que la climatisation était à fond et qu’on ne pouvait pas la réglée,  j’avais demandé une couverture pour mon enfant et j’ai dû attendre jusqu’à 23h pour recevoir un drap sous prétexte que l’hôtel ne disposait pas de couvertures et par conséquent mon enfant s’est enrhumé.

-          Le lendemain j’ai pris un rendez-vous avec la manger à 11h pour faire une réclamation, cette dernière  m’a snobé jusqu’à 11h30 parce qu’elle parlait au téléphoneL.

-          Après le dépôt de ma réclamation le manager est resté très passif en me disant qu’elle allait remonter",4.0,LEILA,2022-08-30,1.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

The check in was late even with a toddler  (we got at the hotel very early due to our flight) .. this place won’t ever help you in that case! also, no customer service at all! we tried to call many times from the room and no answer at all! If we wanted something we had to do down and the answer was always negative! We had a major power outage on a Saturday night and not only any information but we had to stay in the lobby for a few hours (kids sleeping on our lap etc..) no explanation or help from the hotel staff at all… the worst experience of my life 😞 (i did traveled the 🌎).",2.0,Veralucia,2022-07-13,5.0,,8.2/10 Very good,"1,008 verified reviews"

The string to pull the shade up was broken and the rooftop access was so filthy chairs were filthy and thrown around. No microwave. The tiles on the stairs were missing.. it needs to be closed for Renovations. I was so excited due to the pictures I seen online and I was surprising my boyfriend for his 50th birthday.. and it was so horrible.. when you think of penthouse you think fancy.. clean, big.. it was none of the above I would’ve preferred a regular room but those are probably just as bad.

tripadvisor,"It’s an odd one. It was excellent value for such a spacious room. We had a wonderful and quiet sleep. Two bathrooms, an amazing washer and dryer. Tony downstairs was so chirpy and helpful. The golf cart is such a fun experience and the guy at the pool bar was very helpful too. 

But oddly things in the room need Maintanence. The shower fittings just don’t work. The toilet seats half off and the flushers broken. That might be it really so it is so close to be amazing :) I just wonder why they haven’t gotten these things fixed. We couldn’t work the cold water - the handle is just plain broken.

The hotel has a great rooftop with a pool and a bar, along with a courtyard restaurant and a small but well equipped fitness center.
The hotel is 2 blocks from the beach and next to Collins Park, which has a bus and trolley stop and a Citi bike rack.
There is a Joe&Juice coffee shop on the ground floor of the building along with a Walgreens a block over.
Collins Street is busy.

The front desk said that there might be the room we paid for the next day so we stuck it out for one night then packed back up to drop our bags in the morning so we could check into the new (correct) room later. We were informed that the room was booked. So why didn’t the front desk make it so no one could book that room that they said we were moving to which we actually paid for originally. Instead my friend and I had a less than relaxing stay having to share a bed instead of get the room we booked.

We arrived late due to delayed flights and arrived at what we thought was the front door of the South Beach Hotel, only to be told by another guest that we had to attend the hotel lobby next door (Boulan) to check in.  It would have been nice to have a sign up somewhere explaining this.  The receptionist failed to explain how the hotel worked, that the hotel had a private facility at the nearby beach, how to access the pool, gym etc, additional “service costs” for WiFi, room cleaning, pool towels etc.  We have travelled extensively all over the world and have never encountered an additional service fee for these items.  Ridiculous!  The cleaners failed to service the room one day, had conversations at the top of their voices with people on the phone while cleaning the room next door first thing in the morning and the room did not have any documentation on how the TV or hotel operated.

It was very comfortable for or daughter to sleep in the main room while we took the bedroom. The unit was so spacious that we did not feel an impact. 

Staff was so friendly and helpful. Rooms--huge, clean, comfy and was thrilled to have all  you'd want for a trip, especially the washer dryer, 'frig that we coud fill with snacks & drinks and huge bathroom with high end brand shampoo and soap products.  We didnt hear street noise unless we were out on the balcony. Location-perfect! across the street from two other major hotels, food, drug store and coffee shops all within a few steps. All the dining you want is an easy uber ride away or walk. Plus a quick cross the street to the beach.  Beach--amazing private beach access. We appreciated the service, the chairs, the towels and the opportunity to rent an umbrella for shade. There is no food or drinks service but super easy to bring your own or walk to the W beach and order.  The roof pool was lovely, not too many seats but we always managed to get spots.

I rarely leave negative reviews, but my experience at this hotel was truly disappointing. The room was not properly cleaned—there were stains on the sheets and a lingering musty smell. The air conditioning barely worked, and when I called the front desk for help, the staff was unresponsive and indifferent.

To make matters worse, the noise levels at night were unbearable, making it nearly impossible to get a good night’s sleep. The amenities listed online were either unavailable or severely outdated. For the price I paid, I expected far better service and cleanliness.

Also my friend was brushing her teeth and the sink feel on her foot.YES THE ENTIRE SINK FELL! SMH. The staff was unhelpful and unapologetic. They blamed her for sitting on the sink instead of saying the appliance was outdated. Clearly this has happened before because behind the sink was old underwear and razors.

The room had issues from the start. The mattress was broken, the space was not clean, and the bathroom door didn't close (they knew this but didn't say anything). These were all manageable but the biggest issue was the huge safety violation. They do not have proper security on the property so people can come and go without actually staying at the hotel. They gave a key to my room to a stranger! One evening, a man asked to see me and just mentioned my name. The front desk person told him my room number and even made him a key!!! Thank god I had the latch on the door. It was terrifying. I stay at about 20 hotels a year and I've never once had anything like this happen. They didn't call, didn't verify, and didn't id. They simply trusted someone off the street and told them my room number! No woman should stay at this hotel unless you want to risk your safety.

The worst part is, I spoke to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. First I was told the manager would call me, NO CALL. Then I was told the manager would meet with me at 11am the next day. I showed up and was told the manager wasn't available. Then I was told the manager would email me. NOTHING! I ended asking for the manager's email myself and emailed multiple times with no response. It is very clear the manager and hotel does not care about it's guests.

It's absolutely disgraceful to treat a guest this way especially after such a lapse in security and judgement. I will never stay at this hotel again and encourage others to avoid it at all costs. They do not care what happens to you or your belongings.",2.0,Natalie S,2025-01-08,,Solo,7.4,1201

The communal areas were fine, and acceptable for a 3 star hotel but certainly not a 4 star.

The bed was fine, but the bathroom door would not shut fully, and there were grubby scuff marks all over the walls throughout and rust/wear in several areas.

It felt more like having my own apartment than a hotel room. 1 1/2 bathrooms, a deep soaking tub, glass enclosed shower, walk in closet, full kitchen with a dining table for 4, a living room,  a full size washer and dryer, and a wine fridge made my week super enjoyable!  The hotel restaurant, Orange Blossom, was nice and surrounded by foliage. The rooftop pool was chill and not crazy and overcrowded like some hotel pools in South Beach. The rooftop bar served good drinks, and you could order online to have the restaurant bring food up to you. The hotel was pretty quiet, too. The balcony doors managed to keep most of the noise out from busy Collins Ave. below. It was nice to be near the hustle and bustle of the rest of South Beach, but not be in the midst of it. With a 1 1/2 block walk to the beach, and the nearby CitiBike station, while being on the bus and trolley routes, it is in the perfect location. It’s across the street from the park in front of the Bass art museum, and the botanical garden is in within walking distance.  There is a CVS and Joe & the Juice on the same block, which was very convenient.

It was incompletely furnished, almost bizarre.   You get the sense it was a room upgrade done on the cheap and they still ran out of money

Maybe they were trying for some sort of South Beach eclectic artsy low budget thrift shop vibe but for this guy with north of 1000 hotel nights in my life, it was just weird, incomplete and unsatisfactory, esp for the rate paid.

tripadvisor,"I just got back from a 5 night stay in this hotel as part of a business meeting which was held at the Convention Center.  

Pros
1. The location -- Less than 2 blocks from the beach and about a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center.  
2. I had a suite which was very large and had everything I could want for my stay
3. Bed is very comfortable and large.  Plenty of pillows
4. Pull out couch wasn't needed in my case but a nice feature for additional guests
5. The kitchen was great as I bought drinks at CVS (much less expensive) and had a full size refrigerator.  Same with leftovers that could be heated up.
6. Wifi was good 
7. Bathroom was huge with a walk in shower, double sinks, and a nice soak tub
8. Products like shampoo were ample and lots of fluffy towels
9. Multiple closets so lots of room for clothes

Cons
1. Breakfast was a waste as it did not open until 8:00 and most business meetings started well before then.  The hotel should open breakfast earlier expecially given its proximity to the convention center.
2. Front desk staff were not friendly and sometimes not at the desk.  When I checked in I know it was 10:00 PM but I had to get my meeting planner on the phone as the woman tried to charge me when this was on a masterbill.  Once the head of our office spoke to her, her tune changed.  My card was run for incidentals and it quickly came off my credit card after check out.  When I tried to check out it was 7:15 and nobody at the desk.  I waited for 5 minutes then I went to see if I could find someone.  I spoke to someone in the resturant and then walked back to the desk.  I was going to be late for my first meeting so I opened the curtain and put my bag in and had just started writing a note when the lady came back and told me I could not be back there and when I explained I had been waiting about 15 minutes she got upset and told me she was allowed to go to the bathroom.  I just handed in my key, got a luggage receipt from the nice guy who drove the golf cart and he offered to take me to the convention center.

Overall, it was a nice stay and a lovely but the two ladies I dealt with at the front desk at check in and check out and how long it took impacted my overall impression and rating.",6.0,Elise Swinehart,2024-10-02,,Solo,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I checked into the hotel after midnight because of flight delays with recent hurricane. Check in was a pleasant experience and I was told I was booked in “penthouse” 2. How lovely I thought. 

The room smelled like someone had been smoking pot and cigarettes inside just hours before. In addition, the sheets clearly had stains on them. I immediately went back to reception and asked for a different room. They were fully booked. I asked for clean sheets and the receptionist said she would bring them up to me. 

She came inside my room as I wanted someone to experience what was going on. She assured me it would be taken care of in the morning. 

When I went to the front desk they just told me there was no manager and they were going to have housekeeping “thoroughly clean the room.” I asked them to have the manager call me and as the receptionist had said herself the manager is the only one who can give you a refund. 

I never heard from the manager. I’ve since tried calling and was sent to voicemail and left a message and haven’t received a call back. 

It wasn’t just the smell, the room was falling apart. I have several safety concerns with the way rooftop access is set up as well.

They charged a $45 service fee per night, so for our 5-night stay, that came out to a whopping $225. I wouldn’t have minded paying if the services were actually provided. But here’s the kicker:

1.        The pool, hot tub, and beach umbrellas were not accessible, and as such, these services were unavailable to us.

2.        We were unable to enjoy the terrace as all the furniture had been removed.

3.        The daily cleaning service was not fully provided; only the garbage was collected.

4.        I also requested toothpaste, but it was not delivered, requiring me to purchase it myself, so I had to go to buy it in the stormy rain.

5.        I asked for a kettle, but I was informed that it was not available at that time.

6.        I could not have coffee in the room as there was no sugar or creamer provided.

7.        I was never informed about the additional service fee charges when I paid the deposit.

I reached out to management to request a reimbursement for the service fee, but Supervisor Chara was disrespectful in her response. Her manager, Emma, completely ignored my email.

Despite the incredible location and the large rooms, the hotel leaves much to be desired when it comes to maintenance and cleaning.

In the rooms, the situation is not very different: we found dust accumulated in furniture, rugs, curtains and objects, and the floor was far from what you would expect from a high-standard hotel.
The walls were stained and poorly painted. It was obvious that the site had not received proper care in a long time. The bathroom door was so stained that it did not close, the bathroom in general dirty!!

The pool deck was pretty, but the chairs were stained and broken, and they charged $13 per drink, with no service. We arrived Friday afternoon, left Monday morning and NOT ONCE did housekeeping come to our room. There are no door hang tags to deter service, so there was no reason our rooms and linens were not changed for 3 days. Twice when we walked into the hotel lobby, there were two separate instances of guests making a complete scene, yelling, storming around, regarding incorrect bookings, charges etc. I felt bad for the front desk girls, taking the brunt of a poorly run hotel, but these guests were screaming and LIVID.

We have been here 2 times before, and maybe this is the last time before they renovate the place. Anyway, when we were about to leave, the door man recommended us to use their transportation contacts. I asked how much is the price to Miami airport, and he said 60$. So we said yes to that since a Uber XXL would be 57$. So we waited for the car, and when we sat in and he started to drive I asked the Spanish speaking driver what is the price and he said 100$. I said the hotel had confirmed 60$ but that he just laughed at. Anyway he said he could accept 75$. Even though it was not right we said OK. When we got closer to the airport he started to threaten us with leaving us at the highway if we didn’t pay immediately. We refused and he started driving recklessly and made some dangerous turns. I said we will pay at the airport and when we got there I made sure my family was out of the car first, before stepping out myself (afraid he could drive away with my children). I paid by credit card to make sure I had evidence. So the lesson is. Don’t take whatever transportation the hotels tries to give you. Use Uber or something trustworthy.

Because of an internet bug, I double booked a suite and it took countless hours in person and on the phone to get reimbursed and it still cost me 250$US for this incident. Also, this is the kind of hotel that when you ask for bedsheets for the sofa bed, they say « we’ll send someone to your room » and they don’t send anyone. This happened twice so I ended up sleeping on towels. The pool is nice but dirty (lots of hair floating around), lots of kids jumping in, no umbrellas to protect you from the sun and the cabanas are always taken by invisible guest who leave their towels there all day. The rooms are a nice big size but the tvs are tiny with basic cable. Nothing is free in the room, while 2 bottles of Fidji water are on display for 9 or 10$US each. Clearly not the standing you expect from a 4 star hotel. Staff is not rude but indifferent. Like whatever problem you have, it’s your problem.

Both the washer and dryer didn’t work which we realized too late. 3 pieces of ruined clothes in the washer and then had to bring wet clothes home because the dryer doesn’t dry.

tripadvisor,"My family is annual Disney travelers so our experiences with hotels is a little skewed. I made the mistake of reading several reviews of not only Boulan prior to coming, but many other similar hotels. These reviews were all over the place, complaining of dirty, moldy, and dingy accommodations. Many reviews also talked about how unfriendly or unhelpful the staff was.

I preface my review with all of that to say we were pleasantly surprised with our stay. Not everything was perfect, such as the floors, seeming to be dirty that a simple mopping would’ve taken care of. The common areas looked like they could use a good cleaning (hall carpets, walls, etc) but quite honestly, that could be chalked up to it being a slightly older hotel that might need some updates in the common areas.

Another hand, the room was very nice and spacious. It was clean other than the floors and they replaced our towels every single day (which they don’t even do in Disney). We loved the location. I was weary of what I heard about random room charges and what not but we had nothing of the sort. Perhaps me asking for a printout of our receipt was a way to keep everything in check. The rooftop pool was exactly as the pictures depicted. The staff was friendly, so no complaints there, but it seemed like either there were new people there and weren’t quite sure of answers to some questions, or they weren’t sure of answers in general. Also, I was told they could help with a ride to the airport via cab or SUV, and price $45 vs $65, but when I requested a cab, an SUV had been called (I was quite clear) and wasn’t worth the hassle/wait to have them call what I requested. The driver insisted that a cab would be the exact same price despite being quoted those prices above from the bell man. Not sure if this is a Miami thing of bait and switch but it is what it is (eg every restaurant charging 18-20% fee and still trying to get additional tips on top of that fee).

By no-fault of the hotel, of course was all the construction noise. That of course comes with location in the middle of a busy city, but this was incessant from what seemed like 7am throughout the day every single day we were there (spring break week). 

I don’t doubt what some of the negative reviews have said about their experiences and perhaps we just got lucky with our room and overall experience. From what I understand many hotels in the area do the same thing so I think it’s just more common for the area and if you are not expecting that, it is something that will throw off your whole vacation.",8.0,Brad T,2024-03-30,,Family,7.4,1201

Essentially,  if you want a room with working air conditioning in 80 degree Miami beach, or you want hotel staff to be minimally concerned about getting it working, don't stay here.

I stayed here twice, first on March 31 then again April 5. On March 31, my air conditioner wasn't working, I called down and a few hours later a technician came, he pushed one button on the thermostat and said it was fixed, but a 6 degree increase in temperature the rest of the night followed, so clearly wasn't fixed.

I complained in the morning as I was returning the following week and was told it would be fixed

Arrived the following Frida, room was 71 degrees. Air conditioner was set to 71, but 2 hours later room temperature was 75. After trying to reach front desk for 45 minutes, I went down to ask if they can send the technician and mentioned that I raised this last week, and the woman at front desk (not the daytime person who had been very nice and helpful) just repeatedly issued a condescending smile and kept repeating that she'll send someone when they can.

tripadvisor,"Overall the hotel was- fine but bleh. Two things I’d call out that were nice was the rooftop pool and the bed in my room was comfy. There are definitely quite a few things that need fixing though. 2nd floor hallway smelled so musty and bad that I held my breath from my room to the elevator every time. My room smelled like cigarettes which I’m convinced was coming through the vents but it was a better smell than the hall. My room had just gotten new curtains installed truly 5 minutes before I checked in so there was a layer of drywall dustings everywhere and wasn’t cleaned up. And my shower temperature knob was broken and stuck on cold when I arrived- I had maintenance fix it but then it was stuck on hot so I just sucked it up and took very hot showers.

Called and asked the front desk, but she started talking about how the employees don't even have microwaves and how she goes home to eat. We empathized with her but didn't love the way she was dismissive. Also: not even a microwave in an ""apartment-style"" hotel? Our Ramada that was half the price even had that...

tripadvisor,"I am beyond disappointed in this hotel and specifically due to their customer service. 

We arrived later than expected (after 10pm) which would leave ample amount of time to have the room clean when I had in the hotel notes we would be there early. Upon entering the room, the floor had dust and particles, the bed was stained, toilet would not flush, etc. not the luxury you'd expect as their website states so I definitely wanted this to be rectified seeing as it was not a cheap stay and this is unacceptable. I called to the front and the woman was not willing to help out in any way to accommodate or take the time to help make things right and hear out the situation since I did call the night prior to not only extend our stay, but confirm the room we would be staying in. She did not want to hear it. I proceed to email in hopes this would get escalated to upper management. I did get a response that I would hear back in 24 hours... totally fine we went on with our stay despite how uncomfortable it was being in a room in that condition. When I did not hear back after our third day, I followed up with yet another email and there was no response. 

Upon leaving, a comment was made about me in Spanish amongst the two people at the front desk because I complained via email first after calling down the night we arrived that the room was disgusting. Mind you, I understand Spanish and that is so beyond uncalled for and unprofessional. I was with my family had I not been, I would have made a much bigger deal because that is no way to treat a guest who is already having an issue with the hotel.

There are SO many nicer hotels in the surrounding area to choose from so definitely look elsewhere. I spent months researching this trip and I wish I took the negative reviews seriously. This is not luxury... its a glorified motel 6.

The gym is equipped with free weights and weight machines. 
There is only one treadmill and one Peloton bike (membership required to use).  The pool area is spacious, and the water temperature is good. Unfortunately, the jacuzzi massage mechanism was not working during my entire stay of 6 nights. Pool towels are provided as well as sunscreen. 
There is a simple bar in the pool area. I didn't try the restaurant due to $$$!. Bike rentals available. The first hour is free and then it is $50 thereafter?!
A private beach is located within 10 minutes walking distance . Chairs were free,  but $22 for an umbrella.  There wasn't a view of the ocean from my balcony. Although the hotel is listed as non-smoking, our neighbors were chain smokers of both cigarettes and Marijuana, which made it a challenge to enjoy the balcony in the evening.

Check in took longer than expected because a guest was having difficulties with their room accommodations.  When we finally got to our King Suite Room, I was dumbfounded.  The living room consisted of a low slung sofa. It was literally   8"" off the ground and a tall cabinet underneath the TV.  No coffee table, no lamps for reading...  The bedroom was so small that there is only room for ONE nightstand and the other side of bed is against the wall.  This works for ONE person but definitely not for two older adults!  The bathroom was large as well as the closets. 
 Now, after seeing the sofa so low to the ground, I went back and asked for another room as my husband has difficulties getting up from low chairs/sofas.

This hotel is a CATFISH.

What you see on Instagram, their website and Expedia is not what you get.

- Paid for a suite with 2 bathrooms and a terrace but room was dirty, run down and we got a small balcony with a single bathroom.

- We booked with 3 guests but we could only get 2 beach chairs complimentary.

- At the beach you have to pay for umbrellas and only receive one towel.

- Front desk is useless won’t help and is very rude.

- No slippers or robes are available.

- Shower pressure sucks.

- Toilet seat was broken and mismatched — maintenance had to repair when we checked in.

- Room was not clean: Dry food left on the bed.

- Tried to speak to the manager who was behind the curtain at the front desk & was told she was too busy. Too busy to speak to guests?!?!

- Staff has a lot of attitude and will not do anything to make your stay better.

- They claim to be a luxury hotel but it is far from luxurious — run down and dirty.

The only thing positive is that is located across from the Setai.

We tried to get a refund, but could not, and that is the only reason why we ended up staying, but we will never come back to this hotel, nor recommend to anyone.

tripadvisor,"I have been a loyal guest at the Boulan Hotel every year since 2018, creating an annual tradition of post-cruise relaxation with friends. Unfortunately, my recent experience has compelled me to reconsider future stays and encourage others to do the same.

The trouble began when, in October, I booked two rooms for one night, unsure if we'd extend our stay. We booked directly with the hotel to have flexibility, only to find out in January that adding another night required a separate reservation. Despite attempting to streamline the process by changing the name on one room via email, the confusion persisted upon arrival, hindering our friends' check-in.

Things took a turn for the worse when we were informed that due to the separate reservation, we needed to check out and back in the next day. This inconvenient and perplexing policy clashed with our desire to unwind and reorganize post-cruise. Despite expressing my concerns and seeking assistance from the management, I received no response to my email and encountered resistance from the front desk.

The room itself added to the disappointment, with a malfunctioning refrigerator emitting disruptive alarms every 8 hours, a broken chair at the kitchen table, and an unusable balcony door. Such disrepair only added to the overall frustration of an already subpar experience.

I understand the hotel's commitment to ensuring a positive experience for all guests, but for a long-time patron who has consistently brought substantial revenue and referrals, the lack of accommodation was disheartening. A more creative solution or a willingness to even try to retain my business would have been reasonable. 

For something so trivial as a request to stay in the same room -- something that most other hotels can very easily accommodate -- this was impossible for them. Upgrade me for the two nights. Upgrade someone else for a night or two. There’s a few ways to make this work without creating a negative experience for anyone.

I understand that you don't want to downgrade anyone's experience, but for someone who brought the hotel nearly $4k in revenue for a single night (not to mention 8 years of loyal patronage and positive referrals for the hotel), you'd think they would be a bit more accommodating.

A special acknowledgment goes to Pierre, an exceptional bellman who stood out in his helpfulness and friendliness. It's unfortunate that not everyone at the hotel shares his dedication to guest satisfaction.

In conclusion, my recent stay at the Boulan Hotel was marred by poor customer service, inflexibility, and room maintenance issues.

We stayed in a Penthouse room with Balcony, while it was nice to have a balcony there was no view because the railing was high, it did provide privacy on the balcony, I guess. To call it a Penthouse because it was on the top floor amuses me. It's just a room on the top floor with a balcony. We used the bikes and that was a nice amenity. The Orange Blossom Restaurant was great for breakfast-dinner was a bit too pricy for us but there are a lot of restaurant alternatives nearby. The pool area is a great amenity but is very run down and needs renovation-mold on the pool tiles and fountains not working, etc. We loved the access to the beach and the chairs and towels available to hotel guests.

That being said, my wife and I booked a weekend in the PH with the  rooftop terrace...highly recommend! The room was a great size, one and a half bathrooms, W/D (didn't use), HUGE closets. Master bathroom was also very large. This time of year the rooftop terrace is a little hot to spend too much time there but a nice amenity to have later in the afternoon. From the terrace, there is easy, semi-private access to the rooftop pool. Believe there is another pool on the second floor but we never went. Pool is nice, lots of chairs and space, does lack umbrellas, only shade is the poolside cabana which we thoroughly enjoyed...thank you Martina! Service was solid, everyone was very friendly and again, Martina at the front desk was exceptional. 

Beach access is easy, one block east. Chairs and towels are included. Umbrellas are extra, not sure the cost, we did not need one as it was later in the afternoon and cloudy. 

Parking is available connected to the building but is quite pricey, $40/day. A public garage is available on 23rd street, directly across the park in front of the hotel for half the price. Will have to pay to enter/exit, a good deal if you don't plan on driving.

I booked Penthouse room and paid a lot for it because I desperately needed to get away and relax due to some bad things going on in my life right now.  So, I thought I was treating myself to a wonderful stay in a great hotel.  Wow, was I wrong! 

Immediately when I entered the PH5 room, I noticed many things wrong, with other issues occurring during my stay and some were never resolved after multiple complaints. Here is the list:

1.	The room smelled like rotten eggs upon initially opening the door. I was told I had to leave for a while set up an ozone machine.
2.	There was hair in the bathtub from the previous guest – picture attached
3.	There was other dirt in tub – picture attached
4.	The bedroom TV didn't work for 2 out of 4 days. 
5.	The curtains are raggedy with holes in the them, broken off the hardware and hanging down – picture attached.
6.	 The fridge had a headache inducing bleach smell. It’s great they clean with bleach, but the smell never died down and was extremely strong every time I opened the door. Why wasn’t some of this bleached used in the bathtub??
7.	The bathroom towel racks were hanging off the wall in the smaller bathroom.
8.	The couch cushions are worn out, lop sided and very uncomfortable. You sink all the way down with no support.
9.	The bed’s mattress is old, worn out and has a dip in the middle that you roll into. It's definitely time to change the mattress. Sleeping was very uncomfortable.
10.	The drawers on the bedroom nightstand were assembled incorrectly as they close on top of each other without proper clearance – picture attached. 
11.	The drawers in the closet under the safe were assembled incorrectly as they close on top of each other without proper clearance – picture attached
12.	Paint is peeling in multiple places on the living room ceiling – picture attached
13.	Housekeeping supposedly cleaned the room each day, but yet the kitchen sink and shower floor were not cleaned for 3 days as the same hair was in the same place each day.
14.	Out of about 5 lights in the stairwell leading up to the rooftop terrace, only 1 light worked. Maintenance supposedly fixed it, but as soon as he left, some lights still didn’t work.
15.	The bathroom light stopped working. 
16.	The bedroom lamp didn’t work.
17.	The housekeeper would never leave hand towels in either bathroom. I had to ask for them each day. Why??
18.	The housekeeper never left soap or a hand towel in the kitchen. Why??
19.	The housekeeper never left soap in the small bathroom
20.	The pool was closed during one of the days.
21.	The hot tub was roped off with yellow tape, there was mold on pool tiles, stuff was floating in the pool and the lounge chairs were dirty and not cleaned. 
22.	Having to wait in the room while the housekeeper cleaned because she didn't come while I was out, and while the engineer had to come fix many broken things was very inconvenient and wasted so much of my time.
23.	The locks on the rooftop terrace door were very hard to open with no instructions. There was also no way to lock this door from the outside.
24.	The maintenance man and housekeeper do not speak any English and didn’t understand anything I tried to tell them about problems in the room. This communication barrier was very frustrating. 
25.	Both living room balcony doors don’t lock and the maintenance man could never fix it.
26.	One balcony door didn’t close without it slamming into the latch leaving an inch gap.
27.	You need extremely strong muscles to open the 3 large shades on the balcony windows.
28.	The window shades are old, frayed/ripped, dirty, and the hardware out of alignment.
29.	The coating on the bathroom tub is peeling in multiple areas – picture attached
30.	The shower floor looks gross with mold and needs to be replaced – picture attached
31.	Paneling at the top of the door is missing coming out of the bathroom. IT looks really bad.

When asked to see another room to possibly switch rooms, I was shown PH4 which was horrible also, having the following issues:

1.	The room smelled like cigarette smoke.
2.	The room to the washer/dryer was locked and couldn’t be opened.
3.	Neither TV worked
4.	There wasn’t a lock on one of the balcony doors. There was just an open hole where the lock should be.
5.	The girl that showed me the room had a very nasty, horrible attitude. I was trying to tell her what was wrong with the room and she didn’t care. Instead of making notes she just stared at me.

I shared multiple issues with Martina (I may have it spelled wrong) and Elena on during my stay. I had plans but several times I had to wait for maintenance to come fix things that are still broken. The housekeeper never cleaned the shower floor or kitchen sink. Hair and sand remained after she left the room. Elena told her to come back and do a “deep clean” and the hair was still there. Then she sent 2 other housekeepers. How many housekeepers does it take to clean a room??

I travel a lot and have stayed at many hotels and have never ever stayed anywhere with all of these issues, especially if it’s a Penthouse room. Each room should be checked between guests to make sure everything is working properly and is cleaned. Broken things should be fixed. Maintenance and housekeeping spent way too much time in my room, taking time away from things I needed to do but didn't get to. I am very upset over this long list of issues and inconvenience and feel like I should’ve received at least 50% of my money back as my stay was absolutely horrible, the staff didn't care, had bad attitudes and multiple issues were never fixed. This PH5 room was run down and is in need of massive repairs. The furniture is old and needs replacing. I emailed this same information to the manager, whom I was told was Emma, requesting 50% back, due to all of these issues and she never responded to me. I would never stay here again and would never recommend it to my worst enemy. What a horrible experience I had.",2.0,Vinitta G,2023-10-23,,Solo,7.4,1201

There was an extra charge on everything. they charged my credit card and put a hold on it without an explanation. The room was spacious but certain things were broken like the hair dryer and the tub. its always better to go someplace else i wouldn't go here personally and won't recommend it.

The moment we got there there they overcharged us & asked for a $450 deposit for incidentals like what kind of hotel takes that amount for incidentals? The staff was very rude & not helpful at all, when we got our room it had a bad smell to it which was overbearing. The beds were not clean, the shower was dirty, the towels weren’t clean, the terrace was disgustingly dirty as well. On top of that the terrace door was broken so we called for them to fix it when had men coming in & out of the room which was very uncomfortable. Our tv didn’t work the whole time we were there & had to call each day for them to come fix that as well. There was no utensils, plates or cups in the room. The house keepers didn’t clean our room for one of the days we were there & when we asked for clean sheets they were dirty smh by far the worst experience I had & I do not recommend coming here.

tripadvisor,"This hotel is just ok. When you look at the website - from the lobby, to the pool, to the rooms, to the restaurants - it looks like an impressive, luxury hotel. Do not be fooled by the pictures; this is NOT a luxury hotel. It is in desperate need of an upgrade - the hallways look old and details in the rooms are dingy (from walls needing to be repainted, to shower tiles looking sort of gross and rusty and needing replacement, to the lobby couches looking old, dirty, and a little saggy). The windows also desperately need replacing - you can hear everything from the street below. I was in the bathroom and heard music & voices that sounded so close, that I was afraid somehow someone had accidentally entered my room! Turned out to be a car stopped at the light on the street outside my room. They also charge you for every little thing - no water provided, only two free coffee pods, $4 for 1 laundry pod, and some ridiculous price for a toothbrush since I'd forgotten mine. 

I had also arrived a bit early (3:15pm ahead of a 4pm check in) and my room was not ready until exactly 4pm on the dot. (Yes, I know this isn't guaranteed, but for a hotel that was pretty empty for the previous night and my arrival date being a Tuesday, I was a little surprised.) I had a 3:30-5pm conference call and they have nowhere quiet to sit for a private call... and since the lobby is tiny, there is no finding a quiet corner of the lobby either. I might be willing to forego these amenities for a great view, a beachfront property, or phenomenal service, but you don't get any of that either. However, the rooms are huge and have a kitchen, so if you need or want that, this may work for you.

tripadvisor,"I have to write this because of the rubbish and untruths this hotel have fed us. Refer to my husbands review and full story . Effectively sold a hop on hop off bus tour which ended up being a bus trip to a cigar shop and coffee place. Had to abort trip and catch taxi back to hotel. Hotel staff agreed we were misled and tried to get the Miami bus tour to refund, they refused. Hotel gave us 56 dollars back and said they would refund two nights worth of tax to our credit card which would make up for the remaining 100 dollars . On checkout they confirms this again , didn’t give us a bill as we had paid it all in full in advance. No refund was forthcoming. Despite several emails, 2 calls , one answers by Victor on reception confirming he knew about this as he was working with his colleague at the time when it all happened. He also confirmed that his colleague I think it was Martina had dealt with it but she was off for a few days . I asked that she call me as we hadn’t received anything at this point . I didn’t receive a call or response to email. Some weeks later after several more emails the hotel claimed they had settled this because we had taken some mini bar stuff All lies as we didn’t touch the minibar if you can call it that . Now the manager has responded below saying that this was a third party so the hotel isn’t responsible !! Then why are they advertising it to their guests ? Why have they continued to advertise it knowing that this also happened to previous guest? Receptionist told us this and confirmed they wouldn’t be using the Miami bus tour company again after our experience! Why has the manager below said they have credited one nights tax now as a gesture of goodwill when it’s absolute lies .We have received nothing. The hotel is trying to fob us off with different responses. This is all for the sake of 100 dollars! For us it’s the principle now. In addition to this it spiked our last day in Miami as we wanted to explore the city. It cost us 40 dollars in a taxi back. The bus tour was dangerous as low lying branches almost too the eye out of my 86 year  old father in law and gouged the arm of my 82 year old mother in law! It’s a shame because the hotel rooms were lovely and clean despite us supposedly having a sea view which was  almost non existent as it’s set back behind buildings so it’s a very limited view . We didn’t complain about that as other aspects were good . The hotel has let themselves down in the way they have dealt with this.

tripadvisor,"In all, we had a good stay at Boulan but agree with other reviews that the general condition and amenities of the hotel fails to support the ""luxury"" brand put forth in its marketing. We stayed five nights in one of the penthouse 1 bedroom suites with a private rooftop terrace.

First, the good:
- Friendly welcome at the front desk
- The room was spacious and quiet. Having a kitchen, washer/dryer, etc was nice for a longer stay.
- The rooftop pool was great. Having sunscreen and sun recovery lotion on hand was a nice touch.
- Housekeeping came every day by default and worked around our schedule.

Things to know before you book:
- The room we were in (PH5) had noticeable wear and tear in many places: walls that needed repainting or patching, doors that were hard to open because they rubbed against the floor, a lamp that had its switch broken off so it had to be unplugged in order to turn it off, and a couch that had no support left in its cushions and was full of stains.
- While our room had plenty of outdoor space (a terrace, plus a separate rooftop area), there was minimal furniture in those areas: two old wicker chairs on the terrace, one table and a sad looking, single beach chair on the roof terrace.
- Only one of the two elevators was operational while we were there, and reading reviews it looks like this has been an issue for a while. Given the hotel was pretty busy, fixing this should be a priority.
- The beach service is not run by the hotel itself, instead is a shared section run by another company servicing several hotels They charge $22 per day for a beach umbrella and unless you get there very early it's likely you'll be sitting a long ways back from the beach and they pack the chairs very close together. We ended up spending very little time at the beach.
- The pool was great and usually had enough seating, but there were no umbrellas and it being on the roof meant you were very exposed to the sun.
- The pool had a small hot tub that we referred to as the ""trash tub"". It always had stuff floating in it and did not appear to be maintained well.",6.0,Brad,2023-04-12,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"Just came back from Miami, unfortunately during what was almost a tropical storm. Which means we stay inside the hotel for most of the days. I was a little disapointed at the state of the room from what i excepted after seeing picture of their advertisement. 

On a positive note, the room with a kitchen saved our trip as we were able to have meals in the room and with kids, that is a plus. However, there were not enough plates and cutelery available (2 coffee cups, 4 plates, 4 spoons, 4 forks, etc.)  If you have access to a kitchen, it not being furnished is not really useful but we made it work. 

The general state of the room was disapointing. The bed headboard was covered by some sort of fabric cover but i did not dare look under it! I guess the headboard was so damaged that they covered it instead of replacing it. The vents and fire hydrants were covered by a thick layer of dust.

The bathroom was nice and clean which was appreciated. The room was quiet and we didn't hear our neighbors of noice from outside (we weren't facing Collin's Ave.) The hotel is well located and we could have to the beach and restaurants and bars. 

The pool was wonderful. We enjoyed the pool on the only sunny day of our trip and it was the highlight of our trip. The barman was super nice and friendly, The chairs were comfortable, pool clean and the ambiance was great.

Only after several observations I find the hotel needs better quality to detail. A little notepad or paper and pencil would be nice for guests.I left a thank you note on a paper towel for housekeeping. Plus the tip of course!!

Being a building operator I felt the need to interact with the new employee. I must commend Dell for his fast response and caring attitude. He was able to reset my tv and repair a safe box. He replaced a missing door stop and posted a sign for the broken elevator.

I pointed out to Dell the loose bathroom fixtures, dirty vent, a missing island light . My daughters penthouse room had broken missing tile and a large mirror leaning against the wall, not secured.Dell was busy working and it was a hectic time for everyone. Unfortunately I lost the contact to report these items.Perhaps corporate can read this here.

Better communication is needed. Staff can greet and ask guests if all is ok with the room.and report troubles or safety issues. I did like the bed and my wife loved the pillows!

My family’s room also had troubles with shower drains and hard to open sliding door.I did take photos so that we wouldn’t get surprised with the added bill.

tripadvisor,"Some helpful tips/things that aren’t said in the overview that we had to find out ourselves. 

The pictures is what grabbed us, little did we know that practically everything you see costs money - including the space on the beach, the rooftop striped beds. We were disappointed we were offered 1 free bottle of 500ml water per guest then found out $7.50USD EACH was billed. The striped shaded beds in pictures are not available to use, you have to spend $50 minimum in alcohol to use them, which is pretty pathetic especially when there was only 5 people total up there and we could each have one to ourselves. The next disappointment - which is the highlight of going to Miami, the beach. Prepare to face each other like a puzzle and no view of the ocean unless you want to spend $110USD PER DAY to face the ocean and there is only 4 spots when you can fit at least 15-20 chairs. The staff were rude at the beach desk where you receive a chair/towels (not reception, reception was friendly and accommodating). We were waiting for towels and chairs only the two of us when another guest came with another staff member already being assisted and they both left to get them towels and chairs and completely ignored us when we were standing there before they came. They were totally careless and not accommodating at all. My wife asked for a shaded umbrella and we were told “No it’s too windy” when every single Hotel had umbrellas up at the same time. The main hand sanitizers were not working and 1 out of 2 elevators were out of service. Rooftop pool closes at 6PM! - this was a shocker. 

House keeping was friendly and nice. Front reception and the bellmen were very nice. 

We had a room with the King suite and terrace and enjoyed the modern design and large space. 

We came to relax, enjoy the beach and we found it disappointing as we have travelled to many many different places and never heard of beach spots and rooftop furniture costing money to use. For the price we paid, we were better off to do a complete all inclusive and get to enjoy all the accommodations as is always included with no additional hidden fees.

tripadvisor,"I booked the three bedroom penthouse and when I arrived, I was treated very poorly by front desk staff. The room was booked directly on their website and I was unable to mark how many occupants at that time, so it automatically selected 2 for me. The room states it sleeps 6 so I wasn't worried about it. The front desk staff charged me $100 for each extra occupant saying I did not properly say how many were staying in the room. We had 4 adults and 2 kids with us. The staff was unwilling to hear me out and sent me away with no early check in option. I checked back at 2 to see if I could check in yet and they said not yet. I went back at 345 and it was a new staff member and she was even more rude to me. She said the room wasn't ready and I heard the bell man tell her it was and that he brought our luggage up and she told him at 4 she would let me have it. This was the worst service I have ever had; if the room is ready, why would they not accommodate me?!  Both staff member's were annoyed of me and I didn't event do anything, but try and check in. I waited until 4 and then she just passed me the key in disgust with no explanation or greeting about the hotel. I had to ask her where to go and what was included etc. This was crazy to me since we reserved the nicest room in the hotel and were treated terribly. People paying for penthouses desire luxury and serenity and this was not the case at this hotel. 

The front door to the penthouses need to be painted. It looks very old and beat up.  The room itself was nice and spacious. We loved the balcony views and beds were comfortable. We could not take hot showers due to the limited hot water. Both days we were there the hot water ran out very quickly making it impossible for everyone to have a warm/hot shower. There is no way you can use the large tub unless you want it cold. 

The location to the beach is about a block and very close. You have to pay for umbrellas, but two towels and two chairs are included. All of the hotels nearby have ""private access"" to the beach so don't think this is special. Anyone can stay and sale things in this area. The walk to Ocean Blv is about 25 min, but there is plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby.

We booked a Jr. suite king with terrace. Upon check in, we were taken to a room without a terrace. I went down to the front desk and said the room wasn't what I had booked. The woman at the desk said they were giving us an upgrade, however we wanted the terrace as shown on their website's photos. The supposedly upgraded room they initially gave us certainly didn't appear to be any nicer than what we had booked, and again with no terrace. At that point the manager came out and she and the front desk woman seemed to be searching for a room with terrace. Apparently they only had one left, and we then went to that room. The room was awful! It had a tiny balcony, a dirty and stained sectional couch, and it was  just a run down looking room. I went back to the front desk and was told there were no other rooms available for us to move to, but that we could possibly move for our last two nights. I expressed my complete displeasure and left it at that as we had to be at a dinner. The next day we heard nothing from the front desk about changing rooms. Knowing how upset we were, I would have expected the staff to reach out and accommodate us, sadly that never happened. In fact, the front desk staff, with the exception of one nice male staff member I hadn't seen at check in, never even greeted us as we came in and out of the hotel. We travel a lot, and I have to say this was an extremely disappointing hotel. The pictures online all made the place seem lovely, that was definitely not the case. The room amenities were very mediocre, the bath towels were tiny, thin, and one of ours even had a hole in it. I will say that the bed was comfortable and the hotel was in a good location, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. If you're looking for a place that is clean, well equipped, and has wonderful guest services then this is not the place you'd want to stay.

tripadvisor,"We spent a long weekend getaway at the Boulan.  Overall, it was fine, but there were a few disappointments as well.  First, let me say that the service was excellent...friendly, helpful and generally timely.  Also, that the rooftop pool is absolutely lovely and the rooms spacious and comfortable...assuming your thermostat is working properly (our wasn't and had to be fixed). Other disappointments included that our toilet barely worked (twice people needed to come to fix it), it was touch and maybe go every time we flushed; nor was the microwave working...we found this out after we bought items to heat in it. Only one of their two elevators were operating...generally not a problem but there were times when the wait seemed a bit long. Last, we had a junior suite which included a lovely big patio.  The problem was that it was depressingly stark and it ultimately took away from the ambience of the room.  Gee whiz guys...invest a little money in the patios and create a really amazing experience for your guests! Bottom line...it's a great location, fairly priced, sincerely attempts to provide good service; and basically comfortable...but don't be surprised if there are some maintenance issues along the way.",6.0,Travel06942471296,2023-03-21,,Couple,7.4,1201

The roof-top bar is not open, despite the description on the home page. When I asked, I was told ""Well there is a bar at the roof pool, so the descriptions is right, but it is not manned"".

tripadvisor,"I came to Miami for a week to enjoy some music festival activities and go out with friends for dinner. I have come to Miami 25 times over the last 15 years and I always stay at different places. Considering my stay was during high peak season I felt when I paid for the room was very reasonable for the amenities. The bikes are in good working order that you can use for an hour free of charge, the bed was extremely comfortable, and there were no issues with hot water or shower pressure or noise outside, even though we were facing Collins Avenue, which is generally the the street that you hear the most noise on late night. The rooms had black out curtains, which are essential!  And the room was huge bedroom suite with two different bathrooms. The bathroom in the main bedroom was massive and two sinks, shower and tub. The gym was just the right size for a quick workout during a vacation.  This is the first hotel where I would actually come back to stay next time not only were the amenities nice I’d like to give a particular shout out to Martina at the front desk, and Pierre who was always at the front door ready to assist at a moments notice. They were friendly, they cared about the experience we were having, and offered always to help us in anyway, I definitely can’t say that about many south beach hotels, but but these two particular staff added to my experience :-)

I’m definitely someone who likes to eat in the room for two of my three meals a day and so I would’ve liked a little more cutlery and kitchen utensils and a few more dishwasher pods but other than that I will definitely return. Things to make note of if you’re going, if you are noise, sensitive at all, and even better part of the building would be a room, not facing Collins Avenue. Even though I didn’t find it an issue and they have. Illy espresso machine. The first two pods are free and after that they are two dollars each, which is much better than the five dollars charged at any coffee shops along the street but if you want to drink more free coffee, I suggest you buy some illy pods to bring along yourself.   I only had one roommate, but the place was big enough to have four people comfortably.  I travel a lot, but I’ve only taken the time to write six reviews and get this hotel deserves a good one because I’ve been at several other nice hotels in South Beach that did not live up to what they had advertised. The last comment is, I’ve seen other reviews mention things at the hotel needing repairs and updates but I think that happens at all hotels. If that’s something you’re fussy about I suggest  go look at everything in your room and if You need everything absolutely perfect maybe ask for another room possibility. But for what I needed and for what I look for, $1200 US D all in for four nights was worth it. Plus a two minute walk from the beach and two free chairs and towels at the beach was a great touch.

tripadvisor,"I don’t often do this but I’m going to recommend that you do not stay in this hotel. It’s a shame as the rooms are nice and the food is good, but the customer service. That we have received after our stay is a joke. I’ll try and keep this short but basically we wanted to go on the hop on hop off bus that takes people around Miami to see the sites. The hotel reception offered to book this for us, but when we got on the bus we quickly realised that something was wrong. It ended up being a 5 hour pre arranged tour of a cigar shop and other such things. Not what we paid for and not what we wanted. As soon as the bus stopped, we had to pay for a cab back to the hotel to complain and get a refund. We had paid $156 in cash for the tickets.
Hotel reception who had booked it said that it was the bus companies fault, and that the bus company were refusing to refund the money. The hotel gave us $56 in cash and said that they would reduce our bill by the other $100. Well that never happened, and in spite of at least 6 emails and several phone calls, many of which were ignored we finally got a response from them. They claimed that we had run up a mini bar bill which cancelled out our refund. Liars! We never touched the mini bar (such as it was).
So they’ve basically scammed us out of $100 and cost me another $40 for a cab ride, and ruined our last day in Miami. Their customer service has been appalling, they are liars, and they really don’t care.
You’ve been warned. Martina and Victor on reception shame on you.
And they really shouldn’t advertise their hotel as having a sea view. It really isn’t if it’s barely visible half a mile away in a very small gap between 2 other buildings.",2.0,Graham C,2023-04-03,,Couple,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"So I decided to go on my first solo trip for my 30th birthday and it took me a very long time to find a hotel room because I wanted something fancy. The pictures of the “PH” suites are very misleading. The pictures of the entire hotel are very misleading. When you get to the front of the hotel it looks super old and kind of like one of those hotel/apartment building types. Definitely not what I was expecting & what’s even worse was my “PH” suite. It was literally a regular sized hotel room, no kitchenette nothing, just a bathroom and bed space with a cemented wall balcony and hard chairs. The “partial” oceanfront view was MILES away in videos I had to zoom in to even get it. And in order to see any type of view from the balcony you have to legit stand because of course you can’t see through cement. On my second night there, which was the day of my actual birthday. There was legit no power from 9-1pm. This is not something I was warned about at all before booking. Who would book a hotel where they know they wouldn’t have power during their stay especially on their birth date! Crazy! Then on top of everything I paid for that pathetic room they charged an extra $300 “refundable” deposit, which turns out is not refundable at all. They charged $45 per night and sent whatever was left over from there so instead of the room being $535 it was actually $700!!!! I could’ve found a way better hotel for that! Just horrible!

tripadvisor,"I enjoyed my stay here and will be returning. The staff was friendly, the place was quiet and the room decor is beautiful. We went for a birthday and was offered champagne upon arrival, I appreciated that extra touch. While I lived the decor and quietness, I must agree with another reviewer who wasn’t fond of the cement wall & view. The cement balcony made it impossible to enjoy the view when sitting down which was beyond inconvenient. A simple adjustment to the balcony furniture will fix that problem. I like the cement wall for privacy though. The partial ocean view was the most disappointing part of my stay. Had I known that would be my view I would have booked elsewhere. It’s an ocean view technically but only if you stand in the corner of the balcony to see it. I loved my stay but this isn’t it if you want a real ocean view. I expected an actual fridge vs a mini bar fridge in the room so that too was disappointing however for this trip we didn’t have anything but beverages so it happened to work this time. The penthouse is really just an upgraded hotel room, it doesn’t have the extra amenities other hotels have for their penthouses. I paid great attention to the pictures on google, booking sites and the hotel provided pictures as well as read the description several times so I knew I wasn’t getting the same amenities as other penthouses and I was ok with that before booking. Just read & look closely and you’ll avoid disappointment. The only 2 things I didn’t know about again was the fridge issue & partial ocean view.

tripadvisor,"I forgave the hotel for torn bed sheets, filthy curtains and being locked out of our room at least twice during our 2 night stay. 

My biggest gripe was when my wife and 2 small kids got stuck in the hotel lift. They used the lift to go to the pool, the lift got stuck on level 5 (the same level as our room). The lift then went dark and was very hot with little air. All lift buttons didn’t work including the open button. My wife was terrified and the kids were crying and sweating. They used the local emergency button on the lift which activates an alarm bell but no one responded from the hotel. She then used the lift telephone to reach out to 911, after several attempts they picked the line and came to her rescue. During all this time (about 10-15ms) she was ringing the alarm bell and no one responded from the hotel.

When she exited the lift she explained what happened to me, I then reached out to the receptionist who said she knew nothing of the incident despite the fire department marching into the hotel! We also noted a cctv camera in the lift cabin but it was obvious no one was monitoring this. I asked to speak to the manager who is off duty, the manager could not make time to speak to me as I was informed she has an emergency. 

I left a message with reception and even reported the incident on email to the hotel, Disappointingly nobody responded to me.",2.0,Ammar Alhassan,2022-08-22,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I am not one to trust everything on the internet but please trust this review. I stayed at the Boulan in the penthouse suit this past weekend. Upon arrival, after a long day of travel, the A/C in my room was broken. It remained broken for the next 3 hours and when when they finally got it working again, it took a few more hours to cool the room down. It’s august so you can only imagine how unbearable and uncomfortable this was to unpack my suitcase and get ready for dinner in. As I was unpacking, I noticed several key items in the room broken or not working. The safe was broken and they had no extra ones to replace it with so I couldn’t lock my purse or jewelry up. The pullout queen couch bed was broken so the staff brought a roll away bed that sat in the middle of the kitchen…. The dishwasher was broken. And all the balcony doors were broken and could not be opened except for one. 
On Friday, we left the hotel to go to brunch. When we came back to the hotel we stepped on a piece of glass and cut our foot open entering the room. We found multiple pieces of glass broken on the floor and noticed the glass coffee table in our room was missing. So we called down to the front desk to let them know there is a few pieces of broken glass that we found so they could bring a broom to sweep it up. We also emailed them the hotel manager and talked to her at the front desk. A full day had gone by without housekeeping bringing a broom to our room to pick up the broken glass pieces. During this time, my friend also stepped on glass so she could have a doctors bill if she can’t remove it. Additionally, the front desk told us that house keeping reported the coffee table as broken upon their arrival. This is not true, we did not break the coffee table. 
My makeup bag was sitting on the coffee table when we left for brunch and when we got back to the hotel, I found it sitting off to the side and my body oil that was in the bag was missing…. I think the body oil was broken inside my bag because there was oily residue in there. The hotel refused to offer any compensation for the body oil and won’t take responsibility for the broken coffee table. 
I asked Elena to speak with the hotel manager, Ayla so we could resolve the above issues and the staff told me she wasn’t in the office and that she would be in the following day. I emailed her and asked to meet first thing Saturday morning but she never responded or showed up to work… so I emailed again to ask to meet before check out on Sunday. She also never came to work then. I kept getting the run around from the front desk saying she was in the car on her way to work or she was in the middle of responding to my email. Obviously there is a lack of communication and customer service at this hotel. I did not agree to stay in a room where everything is broken and not working. They never did anything the whole time to make it right or compensate us. I will not be staying here again and I suggest you don’t either.",4.0,Ann Elizabeth W,2022-08-23,,Group,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"The one bed apartment at the Boulan was superb, although the kitchen utensils were few and far between, especially with no kettle.  However,  when I asked for extra items they were supplied, although I  was told they had run out of kettles, which I felt was absurd, especially as no small saucepans were available and I had to boil water in a saucepan more suitable to cook pasta for 10!  

This aside, I loved the hotel, the staff were friendly and helpful and the swimming pool on the roof was sublime.  

One warning, however, was regarding the daily deposit which should be $150 a day, within five days more than $5,000 dollars had been reserved against my card, limiting the remaining credit for my use.  It was not a problem for me, as I had put aside a card just for the deposit and local tax to be reserved against.  When I reported this, the manager saw it was an error and did get her accounts department to get it rectified, but it took about three days until it reverted to the correct amount.

1. Location is right next to south beach for your convenience; plenty of life within the area - there are hookah lounges, bars, shops, cvs, restaurants for miles, even an exotic car rentals that you can walk to. 
2. The small kitchen is remodeled - has dish ware, sink, fridge, and microwave 
3. Their restaurant downstairs Orange Blossom is fantastic (got the Parmesan chicken, fettuccine, and red velvet cake) and is a whole vibe! They even rent out for private parties 
4. One of the staff was accommodating with your bags (even have storage for pick up later or early check in) and getting transportation set up 
5. They gave us complimentary wine, an umbrella for the storm, and a refund for our complaint. 
6. Room service was so sweet. She brought us towels and took our trash, though we didn’t need the full cleaning. 
7. A park is nearby if you have a dog or just want to take photos. 
8. Parking is a nightmare, don’t even try! 

The cons:

1. Service as a whole. We let them know that our microwave wasn’t working and they had a guy come up just to say he doesn’t know what to do, and may have to just take it all the way out. We asked for him to come back when we leave for our excursion but left for the day without letting us know or the other staff. Someone else came up eventually and dismissed us, saying they’ll just heat it up in a different room. This was one of our main necessities that made us book the room and they failed. 
2. We had the junior suite with the balcony or “view” they called, it was a boxed area with palm trees hanging off the side looking toward a street sign and walls too tall to even fully see. It had two chairs, simply nothing romantic about it all. 
3. It was a quick fix job. The linens were dirty including the bedsheets having stains and dust in the curtains, the paint was slapped on and trimmings crumbling, plaster wasn’t hidden by paint, sofa is dingy, a door from the inside that looks like from the projects, and shower with scum. Even the makeup mirror had a large crack and cabinets to the bathroom didn’t line up to close all the way. They put some random lawn chair in the living room. Again, the microwave didn’t work. There’s no lamp on one of the sides of the bed nor outlets. You have to plug your electronics closer to the TV. One of the light bulbs were out in the ceiling of the room so it was pretty dim and so was the bathroom.

Cons: Our room was on the 2nd floor near the trash room. The hallway REEKED. It was really unbearable to walk in the hallway to the elevator. The room had a kitchen (great) but almost no supplies. Only 1-2 drinking glasses, plates and a few items of flatware. No pot holders. No dish towel. No soap for the dishwasher. 
The pool closed at 6pm. There was a beautiful view from the rooftop pool, but the early closing time was dissapointing. The hot tub water was tepid. 
There was a soaking tub but the water could only be set to, again, tepid. No hot water for the soaking tub. Weird!
The shower pressure was low and again, hot water ran out while taking a brief shower. 
An air conditioner broke on our floor and our room flooded in the front. The repair people were SO kind, but it was a bummer to have a bunch of strangers in our room for several hours to fix and clean up the mess.

tripadvisor,"We booked a 1 bedroom, 1.5 bath suite for 5 nights at the Boulan. What we learned is that No 2 rooms are the same, the quality depends on the private owner of any particular unit and their upkeep of the unit. Also, not all suites look like the one on the website. We were placed in unit 412 the 1st night. The unit was much smaller than pictured on website. The MB and MBR were very small, only one sink and no tub as pictured. The toilet was leaking all over the floor, the mattress was the most uncomfortable and loudest mattress you could imagine, you could feel and hear the springs. The couch and the pull out bed/mattress were disgusting, stains everywhere. The bathroom door wouldn't come out of the wall (pocket door so zero privacy). The ladies working the front desk had the customer service experience of a rock. I'm guessing they are accustom to dissatisfied customers and don't really know what to say or do or even care anymore. We had engineering in our room until midnight, they ""fixed"" the toilet which included spraying some horrible smelling something over the cracks, we had to open the windows to breath the smell was so bad (open windows on Collins Ave at Midnight = no sleep). He was friendly and was able to use some tools to get the bathroom pocket door out of the wall but we were told not to close it all the way or it would get stuck again. Housekeeping also came to change the sheets on the pullout bed as my 14 year old was sleeping there. We were told we  would be moved the next day when there was availability. A room was ready around 5 pm the next day. It was directly across the hall (room 411). This room was so much better. Aside from the kitchen chairs and the blinds/curtains needing updated, we were happy. The unit was much larger and looked more like the image on the website. The pool, (we only went up 1 day because we had friends at another hotel with a nicer pool) had  no towels and no one was working the pool bar, we heard multiple guests complaining, we just turned right around and left the pool. We NEVER heard from management (Elena) the entire 6 days we were there or after we left. Housekeeping was great, friendly and helpful. Victor at the front desk was the only one with any customer service whatsoever and apologized many times stating he would make sure there is an adjustment to our bill once he spoke with management. I followed up 2 days after leaving the hotel with Victor and the manager's name/email I was given. Again, we never heard from Management (Elena). I finally heard back from Victor yesterday that all the hotel was willing to do for us is refund our our 1st night's resort fee ($36.48. I was hopeful they would make this right for us, but alas $36.48 is all they did for us. There were a lot of people complaining. I would not recommend this hotel.

tripadvisor,"Got this room because we were going to a restaurant in south Beach and didn’t want to risk a DUI after drinking at dinner for our hour plus drive back home. For the purposes of this stay this hotel was sufficient. It was cheaper than a DUI and more comfortable than a night in a cell. We had 2 rooms, a Penthouse and a room with a balcony and ocean view. Not cheap rooms. Both rooms were old and heavily used. The best thing about the Penthouse was the rooftop terrace and the view of the ocean. The penthouse was huge. Had a balcony too. The ocean view of the other room was nice.
One of the rooms was not clean when we arrived and the a/c was broken. Neither were fixed. The penthouse was pretty clean. This is a really old building and things seem to be in disrepair in both rooms. I would not have been happy at all if these rooms were for a once a year vacation that I had to save up to pay for I’ll be honest. The furniture in the penthouse which is the most expensive room looks like a college kids house. 
There is no parking here. All parking is on street at $4 per hour or garages. Park in the garage on 23rd street where the ballet center is. The other garage in back of the hotel is not a good idea, it’s weird. 
We were only here one night and it served its purpose but these individual owners really need to invest some capital in these rooms and the building needs to do the same. 
I definitely would not stay here again as it stands and wouldn’t tell someone to stay there either. It will do if that’s all there is but do not be fooled by the beautiful pictures on the website. I call this a Copperfield hotel. It’s an illusion.

They will have you wait for hours for a room even when the room is ready they will not let you check in until 4 pm. The room was not even clean and they had us wait because ""they were cleaning"". There were still empty beer bottles on the floor. The penthouse was a mess, the chairs outside does not have any cushions, and none of the fixtures worked, the lights barely turned on. Also, there was black mold in the shower and bathroom. The only good thing about this was the beach was down the street. they offer beach towels but they were also dirty. We booked this hotel to enjoy our honeymoon and it was a complete waste. Honestly, the customer service needs serious work. There should be no reason why you can not accommodate their customers, we should not have to wait EIGHT hours for a room. If the customer arrives early, then you should make their room available first instead of having them wait until check-in time. Honestly, this whole experience was terrible.

Took a while to figure out where to park and the info provided by the different guys encountered was disparate. The hotel and rooms seem to have been recently renovated  and were nicely done but some corners were cut. The hallways are hot as there’s no air con. Not a huge deal as the air con in the room is great. No towel racks. No milk for tea or coffee. Water was $8 a bottle. Even the washing powder in the internal laundry was $4. The toilet paper didn’t even fit on the toilet roll holder! I didn’t think that was cool given the price of the room. Some things should be included in the room cost. Also, we were told at check In that housekeeping would be an extra $45 per day! We said we didn’t need housekeeping so they told us to put the sign on the door. There was no sign!!

tripadvisor,"The Good- Location is great, room size is very large. We had the Penthouse suite for a birthday celebration which had 1.5 bathrooms. Great view of the ocean. The upstairs terrace was nice and clean. The beds are also comfortable. The service for the most part was good. They did bring extra towels when we requested. The service at the pool area was exceptional! Most places charge a huge fee to rent a cabana but theirs was $150 in drink purchase which was not paid at all. 

The Bad- We arrived very early and they made us wait over 8 hrs for the room stating that it had to be cleaned however, when we got to the room it was still dirty and dusty. The windows were very dirty. The bed had dust on it and some sort of fluid on the bed mattress. GROSS!!! See pics. The dinning table was sticky and floors had not been mopped. 

The Ugly- They told us that the furniture had been recently replaced but as you see from the pics it is UGLY! For the cost of this room the furniture SUCKS! Shame on you Boulan! The table had mix match chairs. The pull out bed on the sectional was so horrible that when you sat on it, it caved in. They brought in a queen size bed that stayed in the middle of the living room the entire stay as a replacement so we lost some of the space and you hit your toe on the metal as you walked past. OUCH! 
Bathroom wall molding was falling apart also.",6.0,Elleb,2022-05-06,,Group,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"This was a bitter sweet stay at the Boulan South Beach, as some aspects of the hotel were great and some were awful! The hotel was kind enough to upgrade our room to a partial ocean view, however when we arrived up to our room we were surprised to see that the door to the room wasn't locked(closed). We had to manually push/pull the door to close to lock. Once inside we were greeted with a lovely note wishing my husband a happy birthday and a complementary bottle of wine, which was very nice. I place the bottle in the nice wine refrigerator and then proceeded to check out the other amenities, only to discover that the freezer and ice machine weren't working and there was water standing in the ice try. It was 5 pm and we just wanted to shower and change, so we agreed we would notify the front desk on our way out for the evening. However, when we went to used the master bathroom we then noticed the hole in wall of the bathroom sliding door, and the broken shower door(door can't close), and the cracked shower nozzle holder. When we left out for dinner about 7pm I did notify the front desk, and they said they would let maintenance know. When we got back nothing had been done. We the noticed that there was no linen for the sofa bed. We called and called the front desk for 20 min, and finally just went down to the front. Front desk apologized and said she had to step away. She said she would send some one up with them, he would also look at the repairs. As soon as he came in he could see the broken lock on the door and by the time he came up the refrigerator was leaking all over the floor! He put down two towels, and said it was too late and he didn't have the parts, and for us to call down in the morning and they would send someone up from maintenance. The next day they did come fix the lock on the door, however no one ever came to fix the freezer and by the four night the refrigerator was also broken, so all our great leftovers spoiled! The restaurant staff and food was great, and the location was great so that's the only reason I'm giving them two stars.

tripadvisor,"I recently stayed at the Boulan (late May). I typically stay at the Kimpton but I was asked to stay at the Boulan by a Special Event producer who is looking for a hotel to house her production team during the summer. She had stayed at the Boulan pre-Covid. 

I checked in the late evening after playing golf. First, I loved the location and the upon entering the hotel immediately loved the vibe. After checking in, which was efficient and easy, I went up to my room, only to find that deadbolt did not work. I immediately returned the lobby and notified the front desk. A gentleman from engineering was at my door within 5 minutes. He was unable to fix the door. I then went back downstairs and asked to be moved. I was then told that my category was sold out. That my options were to stay or check out and a note would be left for the manager. At this time is about 10pm. The options extended to woman travel alone was to stay in a room with a broken deadbolt or check out and find another room at 10pm at night. I had paid for the room upfront. There was no promise of refund if I checked out. Only a note left for the manager. 

I returned to the room and put my luggage in front the door. During my usual mattress check for bedbugs, which luckily, I did not find any, I found a duvet that was stained with something that was formally red on one bed. And the other bed clearly had food (popcorn) and other items under it. In a time of a pandemic- the room had not exactly been cleaned to the best of the ability. 

The next day I went to have lunch on the terrace only to find the latch securing the sliding glass door was loose. In theory someone from the outside just needs to pull hard or repeated to dislodge it from the wall. 

During my stay I came downstairs 3 times to speak to a Manager only to be told the manager was in a meeting. This was over the span of 4 hours. I had to come downstairs because the front desk never picked up the phone. On each visit to the front desk I was told a manager would call. I was also given an email address. 

When I checked out I left my email asking for a manager to contact me. Since I am also in the resort hospitality industry, it was my intention to provide feedback to the manager before speaking with the producer who asked me to stay. Imagine my surprise when I instead received an email asking me to share my experience on Trip Advisor. I waited a week before posting my review – hoping to have received a response to my email by now.

The Boulan is beautiful and I was ready to be a regular. Sadly, due to lack of cleanliness and no regard to Guest safety, I find it hard to recommend it.",6.0,L H,2022-06-01,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"The location of the hotel is nice because you are a hop and a skip from the beach and there are convenience stores around the corner. The staff is bubbly so that's also a plus but they are not helpful. The room that I booked had lights and tv's that did not work. I called the front desk to help and the guy told me someone would be up to fix the tv and change the lightbulb. This never happened. 3 hours later - When I went downstairs to go to the store the receptionist admitted he did not ask the service guy to fix the broken things yet. He sent a service request right then in front of me which was annoying but hey, at least it will get fixed now right? Wrong. The maintenance guy came in and basically told me he can't fix the broken tv because it would take too long. He attempted to change the lightbulb in the broken light and realized the bulb wasn't the problem. He then told me he couldn't fix the light either because it would take too long as well. At that point I realized I will have a dark living room and no tv in the bedroom. The comforter sheet on the bed had holes in it that looked like rats chewed the first layer and the couch had a layer of white dusty powder that looked like asbestos? The furniture is pretty and the appliances are modern. But the service and safety here is crap.",6.0,Kebra M,2022-06-07,,Solo,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I thought a thousand times before writing this review as I thought that including the Boulan would forever stain my  profile. But then, I thought the purpose of this review is to help others prevent making the same mistakes I did so I wrote this.  We decided to stay at the Boulan despite having a  home in Miami because we wanted to  an easy getaway by the beach. We thought we were being smart in not having to stay in our usuals - the Setai or Edition as the plan is to have a comfortable place to use as a base to enjoy the beach. Turns out  this is a lesson on  ""getting what you pay for"". The website shows a different hotel. Soon as we were dropped in front of the building, I had to double check that it is a hotel. The entrance looks like a housing complex entrance. There are doormen who are not functional ie. they are not there to greet you, nor usher you in nor help you. The lobby does look ok. There was only one front desk person who greets you. Otherwise, they dont even look up. The decor is generic. The room is actually nice and the bed is  comfortable. But forget that you saw a nice balcony on the website. The real shocker is upon coming down at 630 am, we found a lady sleeping in the lobby  - blanket & all. I thought I was in a shelter. Apparently, one can arrive early  & be allowed to sleep in the lobby until one can check in at 3 pm? I didnt ask for that rate.  I wonder if one can arrive 2 days early. Anyway, moral of the story is dont make the same mistake we did. Good luck.",4.0,jmrmd,2022-07-08,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I have heard good things about the Boulan from friends -- yet was extremely disappointed.  The hotel looks good on the web, but is tired in reality. Do think our room was nice, although the Penthouse with balcony and beach view was a bit misleading -- the balcony was sterile and uncomfortable.  Most of the staff we encountered were nice, yet there was one person at the front desk who never looked up or addressed us when we passed by (and the lobby was empty at the time).  On our second morning, when we went downstairs we noticed a couple sleeping in the lobby.  I asked the front desk clerk and they said that they were checking in later that day (check is at 4pm)...but this was early morning.  You don't expect this to be a hotel perk.  It was disturbing.  So I asked for the manager's email address.  I sent two emails to her -- as I always think it is better to make a negative comment in private before you go public on a site like Trip Advisor.  I didn't get a response either time, which is why I asked what I did in the title.  Will never go back.",2.0,HBPR,2022-07-08,,,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"Let me start off by saying that I had high hopes for this hotel.  The location is great and a former boss of mine always stayed there pre-COVID and I always heard such good things. A friend of mine and I went for the Food and Wine festival and booked this at the last minute the rooms looked beautiful online. Even though we were the first to check in that day and were guaranteed a room ready by 4 pm our room wasn’t ready until 5:30. Front desk let another room stay past the allotted check out time knowing we were waiting.  The woman at the front desk was rude and wouldn’t write down her name or the managers, walked away from the front desk while 2 others were complaining.   We finally got a handicapped room which was not what we paid for we had booked a 1 bedroom suite with a separate living room area.  That night the fire alarm went off with all of us rushing out (some people with sleeping kids).  We walk in and ask the front desk if everything is ok.  They said false alarm but didn’t bother to announce it and people were still rushing out.  They were very unapologetic and couldn’t care less. The funny part was everyone in the elevator going up all had the same complaints about the staff as we did. Throughout the whole trip we bonded with people at our pool about our hotel woes.  The next morning Victor who is the only helpful one there listened to our issue.  He ended up moving us into the room which we did pay for and gave us drink tickets After the hotel wouldn’t comp us for the one night.  The new room while nicer could use work the paint was chipping off there were fake eyelashes on the floor, it needs a little work.  The pool is great though and the bar tender Giuseppe is great as well.  Upon check out I never received a bill and had to wait almost a week for my resort fees to be credited.  I had reached out to the general manager with my concerns and never received a reply. The front desk manager was also not the most helpful either.

The service of the hotel however is horrible. We had to wait for 2 days to get linen for the coach/sofa. And it took them almost 4 days to get us hair fan. Not sure if they are just understaffed?

Amazing breakfast variety. So would recommend adding it to your stay. 

Block away from the beach. However be aware that room only covers 2 beach chairs. And no umbrellas.

Wall paper was stained and falling off the walls, floors caked with dirt and dust, the bed spread was stained, curtains had food stained on them. The vanity in the bathroom was visibly falling apart, the shower door lined was flapping in the wind, the terrace off the room was crumbling and felt more like a prison than a hotel. The list goes on.
The room and the hotel were so bad that I had to cancel a night of my stay. I tried talking to management who assured me I would be refunded for at least the night I cancelled due to their dismal conditions.

There were several minor issues which the staffs excellent service attitude fast and reliable addressed.
With regards to the broader hotel for example in the gym the stepper wasn't working anymore, so you are left with a treadmill as only cardio option or the jacuzzi on the rooftop didn't produce bubbles anymore. So overall you get everywhere the impression some refurbishment is urgently needed.

I was told he would have someone to change the sheets and to my surprise when we return for the night the sheets was never changed. When I bring it to his attention the following day he had a nasty attitude about it. Away from the spaciousness of the room and the location I WOULD NOT recommended this hotel!! Parking was $40 a day if you use they parking lot, our room was always EXTREMELY COLD.",4.0,Gwen B,2022-01-23,,Couple,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"To start, I was worried about the property after reading some of the reviews. A lot of 5's and a lot of 1's. 

I have been to Miami Beach/South Beach many times and stayed in two different properties most times. We decided to try Boulan based on a reasonable price compared to the prices at the other resorts for this stay during the same 7-day period. One property we have stayed in the past was $650 a night plus fees for a hotel room. Boulan was a deal at $276 per night plus fees for a condo type room. This is not the Ritz, SLS or 1 Hotel South Beach, nor do they advertise it as such.

We really enjoyed our stay at Boulan. Perfect location on Collins. Close to all the fun, food and sand but far enough away that you are not on top of it. We stayed in a terrace-one bedroom, 2 baths with a full kitchen. The property was nice, yes, we had nicks on the walls and some of the areas showed some age but overall, a very nice place.  

The team was the best part, everyone was nice and responsive. Pool was great as was the free beach chairs and towels on the beach. We had two minor issues and they were both solved quickly. They could have happened and do happen at any hotel.

Overall, just a great stay with great service in a perfect area. Do not forget try the on-property restaurant Orange Blossom.",10.0,Stephen W,2022-01-26,,,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"Paid an extra $50 more a night than my friends for the balcony with ocean view (they got same balcony suite with no ocean view) and you literally could not see the ocean at all. I genuinely thought it was a mistake, but the front desk confirmed everything was correct and that it is a “partial” ocean view. I showed them a photo I took from my balcony (posted with this review), which shows the ocean is not even partially visible. They said there was nothing they could do and that I could complain to the manager the next day if I wanted. I really don’t understand why they couldn’t take down my complaint and report it to the manager themselves …..that seems like a basic duty….and I shouldn’t have to take more time out of my vacation to track down the manager and make another complaint. Also, the room was pretty dirty upon arrival. You could see stuff on the bathroom sink and there was body hair in the tub. The housekeepers did do a good job cleaning our room throughout our stay though. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating (besides the ocean view issue). Location is great as well. Overall Boulan had mostly good qualities and I enjoyed my stay, but the issues I had aren't really acceptable for the amount of money I paid ($1425 for 3 nights).",4.0,Megan L,2022-02-23,,Group,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"Upon arrival to the Boulan there was no one to help us with our bags and bring them up to our room. We booked the Boulan because we wanted a suite with a kitchen. The room we received was not well maintained, the tv didn’t work, a light was out, there were patches on the wall, and it was dingy and dirty. At night I felt something crawling on me, we found there were roaches in the room. The staff didn’t not seem to be surprised and switched us to a 1 bedroom on the penthouse floor. The new room was brand new, clean and very nice. There was a lot of confusion among guests about breakfast, which is not included. There is also no room service in the hotel. The rooftop pool is very nice, but the bartender spends his entire time on the phone. The towels by the pool and beach were dingy. They were out of towels twice at the beach and we arrived when it opened in the morning. They were not serving food on the beach due to COVID, yet every other hotel on the beach was.",6.0,Berjoib,2021-12-26,,,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"We stayed at the Boulan this past week, and it has seen better days. I stayed here a number of years ago and was impressed with the space, location, modern decor, artwork, overall asthetic. It was a dream, and I was so excited for my family to experience it! Fast forward to this past week, and it was a complete disappointment. Holes in walls, hanging cable boxes, broken window treatments, toilet paper holders coming off the wall... For the price we paid (over $1000 a night!) I expected far more. In fact, I have never stayed in a place where these simple maintenance / upkeeps were simply not a priority. The doors to the balcony were very sticky, difficult and squeeky to open/close. The door to the upstairs balcony was locked and wouldn't open at all - not sure if this was intentional, or if the door was broken.
Additionally, we were told there was no need for a car. In fact they discouraged it due to the price for parking, and the hotel had a golf cart to take you anwhere you wanted to go within a couple mile radius. On the second day of our stay, I asked for a ride to a local shopping area, and was told they have discontinued this service over a year ago. Despite the fact that we were told over the phone by a staff member of Boulan that they offered this service.

Outside of our room, the hotel just seemed run down, dirty. Like it needed a fresh coat of paint, windows washed, and a little tlc. 
These things were mentioned at checkout, and the manager removed the $50 resort fee from our bill. We stayed 4 nights at over $1000 a night. And he removed $50 per night. Again, this seems to be in line with our overall experience. 

On the positive side, the location is great. Walking distance to other restaurants, hotels, the beach and art exhibits. The food and drinks at their restaurant were great, and the bellman was very kind. The beach service was also great, providing a chair, towels and umbrella.",4.0,Sunshine790212,2021-12-29,,,7.4,1201

From the entrance, the person who sits you down (Usan, if it is the real name) treated us in a rude, arrogant way, with bad manners and above all, with very bad service.  He sat us at a high table, when we told him that if he didn't mind sitting at a low table (physical problem) he didn't care, hw invited us to go out and finally he sat us hidden behind a palm tree when there were many empty tables.  He gave us the reduced version of the menu, to make ""fast breakfast"" as they said between them.  How rude ...  what a manners!.  I do not recommend it at all.  Today I have returned again because for times we could not go to another place (we are staying at the hotel) and oh, surprise, a kind person has given us a ""not so fast"" breakfast.

tripadvisor,"There was a time i loved staying at this hotel, it felt like a Gem in the middle of South Beach. But I was extremely disappointed with my most recent stay this weekend. to start with my AC was on the fritz and the fact it was on the fritz had maintenance come to my unit like 5 times the first night arrived to the point I couldn't venture out. Next, I had a broken light switch a cracked marble tile on the steps leading to the roof. Upon checking in, to my dismay, I found out the hotel no longer provided a Valet service and I had to go park my car around the block at a garage. No blackout curtains in Sobe is insane, and lastly, the main reason I always upgraded and stayed on the Penthouse level before was it gave you after-hours access to the rooftop pool, apparently, that's no longer an option so it was really no value in paying more than double the price for a standard terrace room if you don't have the after-hours access any longer. I'm torn to decide I will have to find a new Sobe getaway spot or give Boulan another try to redeem themselves. Oh yeah to tell me, oh well you have a credit and it's nothing you can use it for didn't sit well with me either. One more thing you know how it is in Sobe, I had quite a bit of jewelry on when I checked into my penthouse and couldn't believe that the safe wasn't working, so I was forced to wear it the entire weekend versus leaving it on the room",4.0,Allen W,2021-11-03,,,7.4,1201

We flew in from NY with our infant late at night.

mildew.  We booked this hotel for 3 nights and it was prepaid but I refuse to stay here another night. I went ahead and booked the rest of my stay in Miami at another hotel where I usually stay.

The hotel room is a lovely space but the maintenance and upkeep are atrocious. They found so many issues with this space, which you can see in the pictures, including my girlfriend developing a rash from the dust in the room. This was brought to the attention of the front desk and they offered to switch rooms the following day since there were no rooms available at that time. They requested that clean sheets be delivered to the room for now since the present ones were filthy. They decided to not change rooms the following day since it was a smaller space with a lesser view. Moving outside to the pool area proved no better. The pool was dirty. The cabanas, which cost $150 to rent even as a hotel guest, were broken and dirty with absolutely no shading. Tried to locate a pool employee but they all arrived late which is when we were informed of the $150 rental fee. In my opinion, the rooms and the stay are not cheap.

-The location is great.  The beach is right across the street and art deco district is within walking distance.  
-On the beach, chairs and towels are complimentary (umbrellas are an extra $15).  
-Our room had great features (private rooftop terrace, big balcony, big bath tub and shower, full kitchen)

Cons:
-A/C didn't work in the gym
-Gym is small, max maybe 3 people could fit
-The room seemed very beat up and wasn't as clean as I expected
-Kitchen lacked the normal accessories (the kitchen came with an oven but no baking trays, only had 1 fork, no ice maker, stuff like that)
-Pool area chairs were beat up, many of them broken and therefor uncomfortable
-Room was a bit run down (drywall that was patched but not mudded/sanded, couch cushions torn, patio door hinge crooked)

Overall Impression:
The pictures on the website make the hotel look stunning.  Getting there, we guessed they took those pictures years ago when the hotel was at its peak and things have since gone downhill.  A bit anticlimatic, sure, but overall still a great value.  We loved our stay and we enjoyed the amenities of our room and the pool.

The headboard was hanging on by a thread, there were multiple cracks in the bathroom tile and mold buildup, and the crib they gave us for our 19 month old had a broken wheel and my son tipped over in the middle of the night. He was fine but I was awake and there to catch him. I can’t imagine what would have happened with an infant. They replaced it but didn’t apologize or bat an eyelash when I told the maintenance person what happened. He just switched them out and went about his day. We were also looking forward to the pool but when we went, the water was disgusting. There were globs of hair and the water was foggy like people were going in without washing first. My son begged to go in and we did but I made sure he didn’t swallow any of that water. Who knows what kind of bacteria is living in there. And the music was obnoxiously loud. Like they were trying desperately to keep up with the Miami party vibe but fell drastically short. Also, as expected in Miami, staff barely acknowledges COVID. Reception was maskless! I was beyond shocked especially since they should be taking the most precautions as they interact with so many people throughout the day. That’s so Miami. They also said they wouldn’t offer daily cleaning because of COVID which was very ironic. Most of the staff was nice but no one is going out of their way for you. They’re just clocking in. The location is convenient to nicer hotels which is where we spent most of our time but if you have little kids, just watch out as the area can be a little dangerous. There was a shooting not far from us snd a young dad was murdered by someone High. I definitely felt that energy that people were drinking or on drugs in this neighborhood. It’s not a family friendly area unless you have lots of money to spend where you can recluse somewhere more luxury.

I saw marks and dirt on the floor, shower and balcony. One of the shower heads were broken and the tub's. I saw tape on the walls, which look like the people before us, had a party with balloons.

I didn't want to ruined my stay so I complained just a bit to get things fixed without making a scandal. I should have complain much more, because they should have done better on dealing with.
I am writing a review because of the failure from management to deal with issues, the manager was suppose to write me an email to ensure we will get a much better experience next time. Clearly the the discount they give me was not enough ( free resort fee whooo). I wish they would have done better since they couldn't give us an other room.

tripadvisor,"My husband and I stayed for two weeks in an ocean view 1BR suite. While the original design is excellent- large, well-designed suites in an excellent location on Sobe- the lack of upkeep of common areas and suites disqualifies it as a luxury hotel/resort.

What we loved: 
- the spacious apartment with a full kitchen (except it isn't ""fully equipped,"" see below)
- very good soundproofing between units and from the street (a must on Collins Ave), 
- great location off beautiful Collins Park and a block from the beach;
- pet friendly!
- largely friendly staff and responsive handyman.

What we didn't love: 
- overall this property needs a total rehab to replace worn/broken furnishings, like:
- our ice maker didn't work but made a grinding sound, our blinds wouldn't go up, and our sofa had collapsed such that it offered no support. The handyman was responsive but putting boards under the sofa cushions wasn't an ideal solution...
- sofa, dining chairs and bedside tables all need replacement;
- some furniture on the roof deck and penthouse decks need replacement;
- the balconies need a deep clean (concrete walls had beverage splatters);
- the common area walls need repainting;
- while the kitchen is nice, it's not ""fully equipped."" We had no pots, pans, serving utensils, kitchen knives, baking sheets, dish towels, kettle or cutting board. Since we were staying for two weeks and planning to cook at home I asked for these things and got a frying pan and a few large plates, so I made a trip to the dollar store. Suite 505 is now equipped enough for basic cooking...
- to our dismay, this hotel doesn't recycle (!).",6.0,Jennifer Hayes,2021-03-21,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"We stayed in the hotel for an extended weekend during spring break. The rooms are enormous and well laid out; however, the furnishings and cleaning do not meet minimum standards for a motel, let alone a place that was charging us an average of $500 a night (before the $45 ‘resort fee’). 

We brought these concerns up with the front desk staff and manager twice and despite promises to address the situation (eg, with a slip cover for the disgusting couch), never heard back. 

In addition, during Covid there is no housekeeping, and massive bathrooms are provided with two bath towels and no robes. Our separate  request for additional towels was never fulfilled (they were busy, but seems like a very basic thing to provide). 

Overall - poor furnishings and unresponsive management operation made it difficult to enjoy our stay; managers also seem over-extended — there is a small front desk for the two large properties right next to one another.",4.0,Will,2021-03-28,,Group,7.4,1201

Housekeeping never came, and J had to wait 45 minutes for the mini muffin meal that never even came. The manager necer told the workers they were sold out!

tripadvisor,"This hotel is a joke! First they tell us there was no housekeeping our entire stay due to covid so our room was never cleaned, second the phones inside the rooms stopped working so when I attempted to call downstairs to the lobby for the third time because our AC went out and nobody came to fix it for an entire day I had to walk downstairs because again the phones wasn’t working! In addition to the AC not working, the phone not working, and no housekeeping we were on the second floor and instead of a nice ocean view or city view we had what was now a bed of dead plants covered in trash. Our balcony was filthy and the sliding glass door was so dirty we couldn’t see out of it. The people next door to us played loud music ALL NIGHT and the rooms were so close that someone could easily walk over their balcony on to yours SO KEEP YOUR DOOR LOCKED!!! The chairs on the balcony didn’t have cushions and if you wanted a place to sit your soap or personal hygiene supplies in the shower the floor was your best and only option. This place was nasty and the staff didn’t seem to care. The girl at the front desk was not accommodating at all, however when i asked for a late checkout for all of my inconvenience she did offer me an extra “30 mins” 🙃. Parking is around the corner for $30 a day and you have to walk up 3 floors to get to and from your car. The water in the shower never got hot but the sink water was scolding! There is so much more that I could say about our stay but hopefully you get the point. Overall our trip to Miami was great and I can say the location is in a great spot so I’m assuming that’s what I paid $500+ a night for because the hotel was an absolute MESS!

The furniture is outdated, there was sand on the floor and in the shower, wall was dirty, and the cable and the freezer(didn’t freeze first two days then froze everything day three) did not work for my whole stay.

Check in was at 4, which we expected to wait until 4, but we were continuously told housekeeping was running behind. My husband finally got upset at 4:30 and asked a guy that walked up to the desk why we had to wait so long and others that came after us got to check in and finally the wheels began to turn. A bellhop told us he was gonna take our bags up while they made our room cards. He returned and we still didn’t have cards, he looked on the desk and there they were, while the lady at the desk talked to other patrons. He gave us our cards at 4:57! When we get to the room everything appeared amazing at first..... the master bathroom was not clean, the shower had a thick white calcium build up on the floor which was completely dry, the bathtub had dust in it as if it had been vacant and sitting. The drapes to the patio had dark brown stains on them, and the outside table was filthy! So what took so long to clean???
The room would’ve been amazing if it was kept up and cleaned! The kitchen furniture leather was ragged and worn, the the couch was badly stained and worn, the bathrooms needed caulking and cleaning!

The front desk said that the issue couldn't be fixed until the following morning, so the attendant told us that they would take $50 off of our charges for that day. That never happened since we paid in advance. The hotel didn't look as nice as it did on the website. Our room was right next to the trash room so it smelled like a dumpster every time we entered and exited our room. The bedroom doors only opened halfway so we had to squeeze in and out whenever we entered and exited or go through the balcony to get to the living room, the phone didn't work so we had to walk to the front desk every time we needed something, we had flickering and blown out lights in the bathroom, maintenance had to come up to fix our balcony doors because we couldn't get them open.

tripadvisor,"We had originally booked The Plymouth, but got a call about two weeks before our trip stating something about Covid (I could barely hear the woman on the phone because it kept cutting out) and were told we would be moved to Boulan and there would be no additional cost and we would be upgraded.

Pros: Full kitchen, sectional sofa, huge bathroom, partial ocean view (The Setai blocks most of the view). The kitchen was stocked with bare minimum dishware, but enough to cook some meals. The beach was never crowded, same with the pool area. Staff was very friendly and always had great recommendations for dining. They will hold your luggage if you arrive early or fly out later than typical checkout.

Cons: We would go down to the beach between 9-10 every day and there were never towels ready to be distributed. None of the dining amenities are open, including room service. We usually had to call the front desk multiple times for things such as towels, robes or ice.

Overall, we loved our stay at Boulan and had considered returning for a stay in the future... until we returned home and I reviewed my credit card statement.

Two unauthorized charges were on my account, even though I was told at check in and check out that nothing would be charged. I contacted the hotel via email because getting through on the phone was impossible. Michelle responded in a timely manner stating that one of the charges was refunded as I had paid those resort fees with my booking.

She also had attached the folio from our stay which had 3 minibar charges. We made sure not to touch anything on the minibar during our stay since we had gone grocery shopping when we arrived. The folio did not even have the items labeled with what was used, just ""in room minibar"".

Michelle told me that she would review with her staff and get back to me no later than tomorrow. That was last Thursday and I have not heard from her since then, even after sending multiple emails. The charge is still in my account.

In choosing the Boulan, an apartment style hotel, we opted for a one bedroom suite, which was approximately 1,000 sq ft.

The staff were very nonchalant and unapologetic about helping you too. It took FOREVER for someone to come to the room to ""fix"" anything. We couldn't get towels in a timely manner and was told that due to COVID, they wouldn't be cleaning rooms daily (WTF).

tripadvisor,"Stayed here with two kids under the age of 4.  The room size brings tremendous value as we were able to put the kids to bed and still have room to hang out - in the living room or on the terrace.

The staff and pool were both really great.

The free breakfast was good, and a nice touch, but you get two free per room and we were four people so we had to buy two more each day (no big deal).

We definitely used the kitchen, but the hood fan was more for show -- it simply moved air to the ceiling, and not out of the apartment.

We also used the washer dryer, which were incredibly loud, but still very useful.

During the day it was pretty chill, but the room was loud at night -  we were facing Collins Avenue and there was a party a few floors up, but whatever... the kids stayed sleeping so I can't really complain.

The main bathroom (there was also a powder room) was awesome.  BIG shower and BIG tub, which were great to bathe the kids.

We also spent one day at the beach - chairs were included for guests, but you have to rent an umbrella (we rented a cabana/shade for $20 - absolutely worth it)

It appears as if you wake up and the ocean is in your back view well its there but its not on the beach like it seemed it would have been in the picture. Also the pool water wasn't the cleanest and they fail to tell you they tie up $350-$600 of your money by putting a hold on your money during your stay. I felt this was a bit much. This part of my spending money and they tied it up until 5 days after our arrival back home. I don't agree with such a large amount it really upset me that we weren't told this before hand.

tripadvisor,From the moment I walked in I was impressed.. My flight was early and the hotel let me check at that time.. My room was perfect The bathroom was breath taking and huge..I stayed in the 1 bedroom suit with partial view ocean with a balcony... The balcony was very relaxing which is what my trip was for since I had an extended weekend.. The there is a rooftop pool and also the beach was a block from the hotel.. It is a convenient location....There is a juice store at the corner (Joe the Juicer) and many other Resteraunt on the same street and Two to three block south of the hotel you have unlimited selection of Restaurants This will be me and my family Hotel of choice.,10.0,melony b,2020-08-18,,Solo,7.4,1201

Four of us stayed here. Also my cousin and his wife.  As i stated we just walked out of one hotel. It was late and we were tired. We came here and LOVED IT!!! Mischa & Alex was very accommodating to not only us but to the other family members that come by to chill. Everyone loved our hotel the best and said the staff was very friendly and helpful.

tripadvisor,"Interesting place lol it’s actually two hotels so when you come they ask if you are staying at the boulan or south beach. They have valet parking which was super slow we waited over 45 mins each time and they sometimes didn’t even put in the request to bring around the car, we spent way too much for such mediocre valet service. The room itself was very big and spacious we had a ocean view balcony room. But you can’t even see the ocean from this hotel so it was kind of a rip off. The furniture was really worn out as well you couldn’t even sit on one of them. The fridge also didn’t work and would cut on and off so we couldn’t enjoy our food or drinks which was annoying. The pool was nice tho it’s on the roof buts it’s kind of hard to get too. the breakfast was subpar at best the complimentary breakfast was so small. So many more places around to try for breakfast or brunch. Overall we made the best of it but we wouldn’t stay here again.",6.0,TheLuxuryTraveler,2020-03-17,,Group,7.4,1201

It is centrally located in South Beach, close walking distance to all the shops and Ocean Drive, 1 block from the beach and free trolley & bus stop right around the corner. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with balcony; all the amenities of a hotel (rooftop pool, front desk/concierge, housekeeping, etc) with the comforts of a luxury condo, full kitchen (with appliances) and even washer/dryer.

We found out that on Fri & Sat evenings, the garden had show/party scene which our unit was directly above and facing towards. A bit loud for our family and little one, but Iza and team were incredibly accommodating, and helped us move into a quieter unit immediately.

tripadvisor,"We picked it based on the photos we saw of the property. Despite the nice doorman and one receptionist, the overall experience at Boulan was VERY disappointing. NO MATTER THE WEATHER AND WHETHER WE USED THE POOL AND THE BEACH WE WERE CHARGED THE RESORT FEE. The beach was actually a public one and with our room number we were only given a towel on the deck chairs. That wasn’t mentioned in the booking and was charged at our checkout. The pool was not heated and was not usable at all, cleaning and preparation of the pool started only at 10 am, so I don’t know when it gets ready to use. The bathroom was a real safety hazard. The tiles at the bottom of the shower were not placed appropriately so the water couldn’t drain well with no drain in the middle of the bathroom. Anyone can slip on the granite stone filled with water. The ‘breakfast included’ was actually served in a nearby restaurant that served the hotel customers with only two options: waffle, toast bread and the rest were charged. Bad management.

tripadvisor,"My husband, 1 year old son, and I stayed at this hotel. We invited my mother-in-law to help watch our son while we went out here and there. It was the perfect choice for this type of visit (though I would imagine it's great for those without kids, too, as it's very modern and glam). I searched far and wide in Miami for a place that wasn't super expensive that would be big enough and easy enough for kids and this checked off every single box -- our room was huge, we had sliding glass doors for privacy for our bedroom, our mom was able to sleep in the living room on a comfortable pull-out, a half bath was connected to the main living space for our mom, the blackout curtains actually made the room dark, the balcony has walls so it isn't a huge hazard for a crawler or little walker, the kitchen was huge, the hotel let us borrow both a crib and an easy-to-clean high chair, the pool was incredible, there is a washer/dryer in the unit -- I could go on. Despite the weather in Miami not cooperating (65 and rainy most of our visit) we didn't mind because we had so much space to just relax in our room. It was also nice to have complimentary breakfast and the hotel staff and housekeeping were so friendly. Eventually, when the weather cleared up, we also went to the beach and it was nice to have two chairs included. It's good to note that an umbrella or canopy costs more, but not a ton more. We really loved our stay here and would come back for sure.

The biggest downside was service -- everyone was friendly, but by the end of the trip we were joking about whether or not items we requested would actually show up to our room. To be fair to the staff, it was the week leading up to Christmas, and there were a ton of people constantly leaving or checking in and I think the staff was overwhelmed by the number of requests, so we made things work with what we had. This would not keep us from coming back to this hotel, especially because it's a 3 minute walk to a Walgreens, so it's easy to replenish things like soap and paper towels if the staff would forget to drop them off.

Another side note, if you're a family planning to visit Miami -- we learned the hard way that it probably wasn't worth it to get a car rental. Parking in South Beach is SUPER expensive and we wished we had just Ubered to the Boulan and then taken public transit as the buses and trolleys are not hard to navigate and they are extremely frequent. Trolleys are also free. It's also very walkable.",8.0,Dani N,2019-12-27,,,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"Fantastic location
We booked a 1 bedroom condo at the Boulan traveling from the uk we needed all the facilities ie washing machine dryer cooker as we are traveling for three months the room was absolutely perfect just as it had been advertised. 

It had a Huge living room full kitchen, spacious bedroom and Lots of wardrobe and cupboard space to put clothing away it also had really good air conditioning  There was plenty of towels provided 
And the maids come in every day to clean and change / make the bed. 

This hotel is only one block from the beach were we spent most of our days it provides you with a free towel and sun bed when you arrive on the beach. 

The hotel staff are  Very friendly especially Ayla and Iza on reception as we got to know very well with are million questions nothing is to much trouble they were very knowledgeable of the local area  and were able to recommend suitable places to eat if you want to know some nice places to go ask Ayla 
I have to say we found all the staff so polite and will all acknowledge you when you walk past. 

The food in the hotel restaurant was absolute delicious as is the complementary breakfast. 
There is quite a large swimming pool here with plenty of sunbeds but we spent our time on the beach.

tripadvisor,"For perspective let me start by saying I have stayed in South Beach no less than 35 times in the last 20 years.  

Location - Although not on the beach still a great location.  On Collins, close to Lincoln Road, Ocean Drive and still only minutes from South of 5th... within minutes can be on Brickell.  The Hotel itself it quite cool and fits the SOBE look and feel.

Rooms - When I stayed years ago it wasn't quite finished in some areas and seems the same now except the areas that were finished are very worn out.  The patio was very dirty, the drywall in the room was very crudely finished, the bedroom electric fuses kept tripping, the toilet paper holder and towel rack were all shaky. Lamps was barely standing in the living room. White stool material were falling apart and flaking.  List was longer but will stop there.  Our shower's water never got really, more like lukewarm.  Safe worked 'sometimes'. 

Pool - Cool area but needs some TLC... chaises quite old and worn, hot tub rust stain on the jets... area just needed someone to pay attention to various details and it would be a much better guest experience.  

Elevator - has tape over some buttons and little home made signs on other areas because not all elevators got o all areas.  It should have been made clear how to even get to the pool when you check in at the lobby or from the bellman... note you must leave your elevator and then proceed to the other side of the building to get in the second elevator to get to the roof pool... but there weren't any signs in the hallway.  I encountered other people lost asking me to help... and when I finally got to the pool other said they had been confused as well.

Service - Some staff are very attentive while other don't even know they are in the hospitality industry.  My girlfriend went for breakfast but because she was alone they would Not let her sit at the tables as those were for 2 or more people (note restaurant was only 30 full).  She was told she is only allowed to sit at the bar.  Next more a gentleman was allowed to sit alone at a table with his laptop... again service is hit or miss and consistency is lacking. There is a young shift manager and she polite and  kind, nice housemen... those 2 are the best there and we associated with man.

Restaurant - Great continental breakfast, nice setting... packed for dinner and cool ambiance.

Hotel needs some renovation, some TLC, some training, and consistency... needs a proper contractor to clean up the mess from the last guys... 

I hope they use this post to rectify and improve because this hotel has lots of potential... but they just drop the ball in too many areas.",6.0,Pierre B,2020-01-17,,,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"We stayed at the Boulan for a friends birthday weekend (three women in 40s). We received an upgrade upon arrival without even asking for it (who does that anymore!!!;) to a two-bedroom and it was a beautiful room. Clean, comfortable, spacious, quiet (considering it was right on Collins - ie traffic on Sat night was a little loud at times with the “hotdogging men on motorcycles”). The pool was perfect for us - plenty of chairs and cabana beds, quiet but good music for a good vibe. The service and food though!!!! That’s what was so great about this hotel. The staff actually got to know us and took care of us!  Thanks to Tony (pool), Michael and Pierre (concierge), Namanja (bar in the beautiful new courtyard restaurant), my tall beautiful friend (she works the night shift at the desk). The food for breakfast was great, the food for dinner was amazing and the lunch at the pool was solid. With the hotel being on the 20th block of Collins you were close to everything, 20min walking distance to “the scene” around 10th block or a ~10$ cab ride to that area.

tripadvisor,"Let me start this off by saying that the staff at this hotel absolutely made my trip unforgettable and I am so thankful. My best friend had flown in from California to attend a concert with me in Miami so we originally booked the studio queen room so we could have a place to get ready in and crash after the concert (which was walking distance at The Fillmore), all without breaking the bank. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door by John who was very helpful and all smiles as he escorted us to check in. At check in, we were immediately greeted by Iza, the delightful front desk girl, who quickly informed us that our original room was unavailable. I honestly feared the worst, until she said that we were instead being upgraded to a 2-bedroom oceanfront suite! I could not believe it. I am definitely not one of those lucky people that experiences this sort of thing often, so I was overjoyed. Thanks to Iza our night went from ordinary to absolutely extraordinary. The room was incredible and came fully equipped for a good time!! Panoramic views of the ocean from the wrap around balcony and large luxury bathrooms with a master bathtub big enough for 2. I could go on and on..... To say the least, we fully enjoyed ourselves and can not speak highly enough about the incredible staff that made it all happen.

tripadvisor,"I think that Boulan is probably one of the best hotel room experiences that I have had. The room was absolutely huge with beautiful appointments and fixtures. It felt like a home away from home. The staff was very responsive when we needed things and the experience was  great overall. HOWEVER, there is a smell in the lobby that is pungent and almost insurmountable. My friend and I attempted to scale the building up and down from our balcony to avoid the lobby altogether (kidding). 

It wasn’t clear that any attention has been given to the lobby despite the beauty of the rest of the building. I would absolutely stay here again.",6.0,Evan,2019-10-04,,Couple,7.4,1201

Sorry that I did not have time to take photos of the room especially the kitchen/ living room/ patio and bathroom areas. I did see water from the patio.The kitchen was fully furnished and with washer and dryer. Great with 15 month old who had plenty of space to roam.
You have to go around the corner for meals as there is no restaurant in the hotel. I give the included breakfast a fair rating as I was not impressed. The waiters who took me to my seat did not even say you can get scrabbled eggs on toast until another told me when I asked for alacarte  menu.
Street parking is $4 an hour or valet parking for overnight $40. There is a Walgreens or Deli nearby.

tripadvisor,Everything was terrible. Once we checked in after waiting 3 hours we looked around to survey our room. The bed was uneven and uncomfortable. The washer and dryer closet was locked so we couldn't wash or clothes. Which we wanted to do because we just came back from a 8 day cruise. That was the purpose of booking that type of room. They moved us to another room two days later and one of the closets to hang our clothes was locked in that one. Not to mention the$150 a day hold that was not discussed prior to booking or at check in and nowhere in their website so they had $600 on hold that we couldn't access which was spending money. Out of all the apartment hotels we stayed in this was the worst one. Never will we ever stay there again. They offered no compensation for the many inconveniences. Also never said anything about construction as well.,2.0,dmill1973,2019-11-15,,Group,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"What can we say about Boulon South Beach? This has to be in the best locations on South Beach. We were near the Bass Museum, Great Restaurants and Things to do in South Beach, without feeling overwhelmed by a city lifestyle. 

For this trip, this was our anniversary and we brought our dog Biscuit with us. Boulon accommodated us very well, and the staff was attentive. 

Check-In:
We arrived around 5:30, the bell staff gathered our things from our car and proceeded to carry them up to our room while we checked in. Then, valet took our car to park and would be available throughout our stay with 10-15 min notice.

The Room:
The room is massive and has to be one of the best values in South Beach. For the cost of a hotel room, you’re essentially getting an apartment, with a balcony, kitchen, living room and 2 bathrooms. This felt so spacious, it’s almost like a home away from home. The room was also very clean and you can tell that special care was taken to keeping the room clean.

Dining:
The first place we dined for Dinner was Orange Blossom (2000 Collins Ave #7, Miami Beach, FL 33139). We had 2 margaritas, lamb chops, toasted ravioli, and cheesecake. Great food and venue. For Breakfast, we had Orange Blossom again with waffles, home fries, eggs, coffee, and fruit. On our last night, we dined at Diez y Seis located inside the Shore Club. (1901 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139). We had the Tamale, Short Ribs and the drinks were fantastic.

The Stay:
Overall, since we’re Ft. Lauderdale residents, this was a great stay to get out of town for a nice quiet weekend. We’d highly recommend this to couples looking to get away or families that don’t want to stay home and have a place big enough to accommodate larger groups of people in a part of South Beach that is in the middle of it all.",10.0,Emilio T,2019-11-17,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"Myself and my friend stayed here for 2 nights prior to a cruise. The location one block from South Beach was great and within walking distance to many restaurants and Lincoln Road Mall.
We encountered a few maintenance issues with the standard room we were initially given but as soon as we called the front desk someone came up within minutes to sort out the AC which wasn't working correctly, However the next morning there were problems with the hot water water so Isla on the front desk upgraded us to a far better room with a huge terrace, kitchen and living area and a beautiful bathroom. The difference to our first room was like night and day. 
The hotel also has its own area on the beach and provides sunbeds and towels for guests included in the resort fee. The nearby Orange Blossom restaurant is where guests take the complimentary breakfast. It also does great food for lunch and dinner.
Melissa and Isla always welcomed us with a friendly smile and chat when we passed by the reception desk. They truly made what would have been an average stay into something special.

They finally came the second day to fix it and it took 5 hours so we could not use our own bathroom or shower. They finally fixed the toilet in by the evening of our second day. The last day our toilet didnt flush. I called at 8 am and they said they were sending someone to fix it. I also said I wanted to speak to a manager and she said a manager did not come in until 11am and she would have her call me as soon as she arrives, which never happened. This was our departure day and we waited around not showered or able to use the bathroom before having to board our cruise. When we checked out, the toilet was still not fixed and I spoke to the manager and she swore she would contact me right away via email as soon as she figured out what went on. I have not yet heard back from anyone and we checked out August 17th. I am completely disgusted by the service of this hotel.

tripadvisor,"So I am one of those people who uses Trip Advisor before booking any hotel or vacation, but never EVER takes the time to write a review. This is an exception. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. I am still on cloud 9 from hosting my sister’s bachelorette party two weeks ago. For any maid of honor out there, you know that choosing accommodations is the most stressful part of the process. I wanted to pick something that everyone would love. I wanted a hotel that was close to the beach, had a nice pool, and was a good location for restaurants and bars/clubs. I had stayed at The Plymouth Hotel before and knew that one of their sister-properties had amazing penthouse suites. My sister’s request was that I find a hotel/apartment big enough for everyone to stay together, with a good sized common space. I booked a two-bedroom penthouse suite at The Boulan and it was the BEST decision I made. The suite comfortably accommodated our group of 7 girls. It had everything we could possibly need. There was a wrap around balcony with amazing ocean views. The bathrooms were spacious. The beds were SO comfortable! The decor was gorgeous, which was also something my sister really wanted. Service was excellent. We had private access to the rooftop pool directly from our suite. Tony was the server by the pool and he made sure to keep our drinks filled. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. We were within walking distance from the best restaurants and nightlife in Miami. I could not have been happier with my decision to book The Boulan for my sister’s bachelorette party. If you’re looking for a great hotel for a group getaway, a family vacation, or even for just you and your significant other, I highly recommend The Boulan.",10.0,Eva R,2019-09-21,,Group,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"Location was amazing literally 2 seconds from the beach and 5 mins from the center. We stayed in the King Suite with a terrace, the terrace was HUGE with 2 chairs but unfortunately no beds or table on the terrace and it had not been cleaned, there were cigarettes and rubbish on the terrace.  
The room itself was nice and a good size, though worn and tired, the mattress was too small for the bed so there were big gaps all around the bed frame and scuff marks on the bed and walls etc. 
We had breakfast included at the Orange Blossom literally around the corner. Lovely restaurant but did not cater for Gluten Free- they didn't even offer bread, so it was a bowl of fruit each morning for me. 
We booked with Expedia who lead us to believe there would be no additional costs at the property, however there was the £32 resort fee per day so that added to our cost. 
We use the valet park which was $40 a day and highly recommend this! Great service- your allocated a number and each time you want the car you ask the man outside the hotel with the number and they have the car outside within 5 mins. You can go in and out as much as you like. Upon arrival if you wish to use this service park out front (ignore the signs saying tow warning) just be sure to tell them on reception when you check in you wish to use this service. We spent agers working out how to get into the car park prior to check in so this info would have been useful. 
Rooftop pool- another amazing gem of the hotel wasn't ever busy quite a lot of beds and only about 10 people at any one time around the pool, they have free suncream and aftersun on the table at the pool and also ping pong tables and Jenga.

tripadvisor,"We booked this hotel 3 months prior to arrival. It was booked as it looked fresh clean, included breakfast, close to the beach, and included a gym.

Upon arrival to the hotel we were informed of the $30 +tax per night service charge and a deposit of $600. We were directed to our room where we noticed that whilst the decor is desirable with a spacious bathroom it is somewhat dirty. The floors are dirty and there were cigarette butts left on the veranda obviously from the previous visitors. There was no bedding left for the already pulled out sofa bed. (we arrived at midnight with a very tired 6 year old) 

Day 2 once we had found our bearings and managed to get some shopping in we found the toaster wasn't working, there is no welcome pack provided with instructions on how to use the cooker/hob or any other electronic equipment, so could not even turn the hob on. After an hour of trying to find how to turn the hob on my husband found out why. The breaker had been isolated in the breaker box so it could not be used. Once he reset the breaker he established it was because one ring could not be turned off. To isolate the breaker means they are aware of the fault yet refusing to repair. 

No tea spoons to make tea/coffee. 

I decided to go to the gym to be informed it was under renovation. No mention of this when we checked in. No notification in the room. No forward notice when booking. My husband and I train every day so this was an important factor when looking for somewhere to stay in Miami. So we now have a further 12 days without the facility to train. 

An outside seated bar area located within the hotel is also ""closed for renovation"" yet we are yet to see any work being done.

Breakfast whilst it is stated is only for 2 people is not great as you have to pay for the rest of your party. There is no subsidised cost for the rest of your party or children's menu. So breakfast for 3 of us even though 2 were complimentary costed $25.

We are off to the beach this morning where we have 2 free beds. So will have to share or pay for a third and umbrellas are not included.

tripadvisor,"Warning to anyone who has interest in staying at this hotel and expects a 4.5 star hotel, do NOT trust the pictures, trust all of the horrible reviews that this place has gotten. The Boulan has potential to be a good hotel, great space and location near all of the other luxurious hotels on the strip however the second I walked into it I was immediately disappointed and shocked by the state of it and the “4.5 star” rating it claims to have. I went for a work trip with another colleague, the lobby (if you can even call it that?) smelled horrible, there is absolutely not sense of security from the street into the hotel and you can barely even tell who works there and who has walked in off the street. There was construction going on in what I guess would be the lounge and bar area of the hotel, with caution tape everywhere and paint samples on the walls right when you walk in. Besides the horrible entrance the rooms were another issue. They also had a horrible smell, one smelling like urine, with couches that looked like they had been used for 10 years and attempted to cleaned up with a vacuum. The doors and fixtures were all falling apart with paint chips on them and there was absolutely no consistently from my room to my colleagues, the appliances, toilet, bathroom fixtures, lamps etc were different from room to room. There were no trash bins anywhere in the rooms even though they attempted to look like full kitchens. The weirdest thing about the hotel and rooms was the lack of decor - no paintings, flowers, nothing on the walls for decoration, no clocks, there was not even plus next to the bed!!!! The balcony, in my friends room because I did not have one I had only high windows starting halfway through the wall, did not have any furniture on it. My hairdryer had an alarming dried substance on it, nothing looked or smelled clean, there were stains all over the counter tops, bedside tables and ceilings. We figured out one day in that although our balcony door looked locked it did not lock, neither did either of the front room door dead bolts appear to work properly. As two young girls traveling alone in Miami we felt completely unsafe walking in and out of this hotel to sleep besides the fact that everything was in horrible condition. Although it looks like it is under construction to be a decent hotel it should NOT have guests staying there and for this amount of money that they charge, which we compared to the other surrounds hotels (the W, Hilton, even 1 house, soho house and more) and the prices were basically comparable. I left and my friend moved hotels the third night because of the state of this. I left my Clarisonic and called back 8 hours later to see if they had it and they did not have it because it had “not been turned in” even though they had cleaned the room right after i left, and offered me absolutely no solution for this - shocker. I hope they take this review seriously and stop fooling the guests that pay $200+ a night to stay here, it is a RIP OFF.",2.0,718gsl,2019-07-12,,Solo,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,We visited overnight while taking a holiday in south Florida . A good central location in south beach with valet parking . We had a very spacious and comfortable room with an equipped kitchen but no kettle which would have been nice . The balcony was huge - shame no loungers on it .

tripadvisor,"We were recommended to stay at the Boulan hotel. It looked great with a nice location. We even talked to the reception in person the day before we checked in. The hotel rooms are very nice and spacious.
HOWEVER.... In our first night we got victims of a burglary! I lost a 50.000 dollar watch and my wedding ring and approx 5.000 use in cash. My family slept in the room while it was stolen. I did not put my items in the safety deposit box since I felt safe because we were in the room sleeping. In the morning when I discovered that it was stolen I contacted the reception and panicked. They call the police ofcourse for an investigation, The hotel manager waited 3 (three) days to hand over the video surveillance videos to the police. The explanation was that they wanted to see what happened 
AND that their IT-guy could not send it over fast to the police because the video file was so large.
We checked out directly of course even though they said we could stay two more night for free. I was not insured in any way ( not even travel insurance, my mistake )
Don't stay at this hotel. It is not safe, staff is not realiable and the hotel is not safe.
They promised me many times to get back to me with some sort of solution, but never a word from them in six months.
Choose another hotel!!!!",2.0,Jacobsson,2019-07-18,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I was a little surprised when we arrived as although this property advertised it had a private beach, it was infact a block back, but that was probably my fault for misunderstanding the description. 

We also got free breakfast for 2 in the near by cafe Orange blossom - slightly annoying as we were charged a supplement to accommodate our 2 teens so why should they not get breakfast?  Also this cafe is open to the public so some mornings the queue was very large and we had to wait along time for a table. 

Pros
Great location, walking distance to everything in south beach, but quiet enough to be out of the noise. 
Enormous 1 bed suit enough room for 4. 
Molton brown products in bathroom. 
Big balcony great view of Collins Avenue. 

Cons
Weird huge mirror left against the wall, I was constantly worried this was going to fall. 
Sofa bed mattress was very thin. My kid just slept on the sofa. 
Attention to detail- grout & seal in shower was disgusting. 
Only 2 coffee pods for free for a stay for 4 people for 5 nights was a bit tight.",8.0,gillandtom,2019-07-19,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"We did a two week roadrtip trough Florida, the Boulan South Beach was our sixth hotel. Four others were also 4 star hotels, one other hotel was a 3 star hotel so we've stayed in enough hotels to compare them to. The Boulan was definately our most expensive hotel and should have been de most luxurious one. It totally did not meet our expectations, here's why:

1. The furniture and maintenance of the building:
The pool chairs were realy worn out, stained and damaged. As a reaction on a review dated March 18th 2019 the manager claims that all the pool beds have been replaced. We can confirm thas this is not the case.
Same for the furniture in our room, a worn out sofa en closets. All walls were stained, had marks and holes and small damages. Curtaines also dirty and stained. 
There was no air conditioning in the hallways or elevators, once you came out of your room, the heat was immediately there. Lifts were very slow, at least a 5 minute trip to go one floor up to go to the pool. The building itself is poorly isolated, you could hear every street noise and it is quite noisy in Miami South Beach. 

2. Pool experience:
There is no supervision of any kind. Dirty towels are piled up, clean towels nowhere to be found. There was a dog running around on the pool deck, people eating Mc Donnald's take out, children with take out pizza IN the pool. There is no possibility to order a drink, even drinking water was nowhere to be found.

3. Private beach experience:
Since the pool wasn't a success, we went to the private beach. It was actually not a private beach but one runned by a third party. After searching five minutes for someone who could explain us which part was available for Boulan guests, we learned that only two chairs and two towels were included in our hotel stay, for an umbrella we needed to pay an additional 15 USD each time. Is there anyone who stays on the beach without an umbrella when it is over 100 degrees outside??

4. Valet parking:
The only parking option is valet parking for 40 USD per day. Again, the valet parking is runned by (another) third party. We tried to get our car four times, nobody of the valet company anywhere to be found. Second day we saw someone from the valet company when we returned from breakfast en we asked to get our car ready in half an hour, the answer: we cannot do that, you have to come back ten minutes before you want your car. We returned 20 minutes later and guess what, no valet employee anywhere around. We were that irritated that we took an Uber (cost of 26 USD at our own expense).

5. Breakfast:
Again, runned by a third party. Very limited choise, you can pick one dish per person out of 7 or 8 possibilities. Dishes are very small, my husband could easily eat three of those (we are European, so in general we don't eat much). The breakfast place is very small and crowed, also guest of other hotels have to eat over there. First day we were seated almost in the door opening, I think the waiter bumped into my chair about 20 times. 

6. Third party cooperation and responsibility:
Since parking, beach and breakfast are runned by three different independant companies, the hotel management/staff feels like they have nothing to do with these matters, however I feel like parking, beach as well as breakfast are important aspects for a successful hotel experience. 

7. Wifi:
Only wifi in your room, not in the hallways, gym nor on pool deck. Very annoying since we're European and don't have 4G outside of Europe. 

8. We were a little bit lost:
There was no information guide, hotel map or direction signs available anywhere in the hotel. We searched about 10 minutes to find the pool. We didn't find te gym so went to the front desk to ask where we could find the gym and got the answer: 'I don' 't know'. We later found out that that person was the assistent manager. 

9. Room types:
We stayed three nights, after the second night they found out the we should be in a king suite instead of a standard room. We switched rooms, but no apologies nor compensation were offered. 

10. The assistant manager:
When we checked out, I explained all the above to the reception desk employee. She responded understanding but was also rather powerless. I feel very sorry for her since she realy did everything in her power to make our stay as pleasant os possible. However the assistant manager was right next to her during this whole conversation and she didn't even lift her head, she did ssssshh the reception desk employee when she tried to get her attantion, so she definitely must have known what was going on.

11. Accidental credit card charges:
They randomly charged our card for 163.13 dollars without our permission, without us signing of on the transaction. We e-mailed our credit card statements to the reservations departement and a manager named Anthony replied us several times that they couldn't find a charge. Later we e-mailed the front desk and they helped us out. After 10 days we received our money back. 

All together we paid the three nights king suite + 120 dollars parking, 26 dollars for an Uber since it was too difficult to get our car, 90 dollars service fee for actually a lack of service and 15 dollars for an umbrella on the beach = room price + 251 dollars extra... Since I feel like we deserve an answer and compensation for this very unpleasant and disappointing experice, the reception desk employee advised us to write this review, apparently it's the only way to get the (assistant) managers attention. Let's now hope for the best, an: 'I'm sorry, we hope you reconsider' will not feel sufficient.",2.0,Paw,2019-07-19,,Couple,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"Came with a few girl friends for a fun getaway trip, left with a smile on my face. 

The Boulan truly has the best service in town and everyone there treats you like family. If you're looking to leave with a really nice tan, they have an amazing rooftop pool deck (the sunset view is a plus). Steps away from the hotel is Orange Blossom which has the yummiest food whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 

We stayed in one of the suites which came with a large kitchen, living area, balcony, deep tub, walk in closet, & washer/dryer in room. The kitchen was amazing for nights we wanted to stay in and have home-cooked meals.

tripadvisor,"Booked 4 nights at the Boulan in june 2019 and was wholely looking forward to out stay as it was advertised as luxury hotel and we got a very reasonable deal. The staff on the front desk were very friendly. But the room we got had paint stains on the tiles in the rooms, no safe and the sofa was torn to shreds, hardly luxury in my book.

The offered us a complimentary upgrade but for the next two days staff kept calling and knocking on our door to find out when we will be checking out. Strange considering they had all these details from the start. Communication between staff left a lot to be desired. 

During our stay we had a whole day where there was no electricity in the room, acceptable as we didnt spend much time in the room, but the time we did spend in there was a struggle. 

My booking included breakfast each morning, however upon arriving in the morning we were told breakfast was from the restaurant adjacent to the hotel. The complimentary breakfast for hotel guests were 4 or 5 items from their menu which were all sweet items, extremely poor for a luxury hotel guest! We ended up paying for 2 of the mornings to just get some toast and eggs. 

Lastly, i spent two days requesting late check out, was told I'd have to wait till the day we check out to see availability. On the day, we were told of the charge which was fine however check out was at 11 but the manager did not turn up till midday and the staff at the front desk said there was nothing they could do without the manager. Was disappointed with the lack of someone to help or make a decision. 

After 12.30 check out was agreed, i had another member of staff turn up to say we had missed check and theyd help with the bags. Again communication between staff is something that needs improvement.

I paid over £700 in the end for a stay that was quite average, and I don't think I would recommend for a ""luxury"" stay as advertised.",6.0,Gina S,2019-06-10,,Couple,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"OMG...where do I start. Like some other recent posts, I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!!! Here are some real pictures. Since our room was going to be ready until 4 p.m., we thought we would enjoy the pool. Ripped lounge chairs, cups and cigarette containers left on their grassy areas and inside the hot tub. Only one attendant. As nice as she was, there was just to much for her to do to manage cleaning up after people, taking food/drink orders, towel duty, refilling suntan lotion station. Sad! 
The ""Manager"" Anthony was so rude. He wanted to argue about our room not having breakfast included. OMG...their own website says (From a dialed-in Concierge to meet any request at any time to “always complimentary” perks like Wi-Fi, breakfast for two each morning and two chairs daily for your visit to the beach, we’ve designed a guest experience that revolves entirely around you.). The emailed confirmation stated it was included. After having the concierge from my credit card company calling him, he agreed. Never an apology. 
At 4 p.m. we go to check in to our room. The lobby is filled with people. So I guess guaranteed ready by 4 p.m. has a different meaning to them. Many rooms were not ready. After getting into our room (see other photos) we noticed ripped old chairs and the cable box dangling on top of the TV. What...who has rooms like this. I would be so embarrassed if I was the owner/manager!
It gets worse, but I hope this gives you enough to stay away from this place. Many other/better choices around. Live life and enjoy somewhere else!!!",2.0,Gary S,2019-04-26,,Couple,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"I think they need to upgrade the front desk hospitality. It was the first time I traveled and nobody checked in on me to see if everything was ok or even if anything was needed. 
When you call the front desk it hard to reach soembody. 
The hotel is nice but could be fixed up. My bed wasnt comfortable eveything was stiff. The pillows were stiff eas very hard to get comfortable. I had an 11 day stay. I'm not sure I'll be back. 
The gym is so small I was charged ressort fees and I dont think I should have at this point. 
I'm giving it a 3 star because I'm not sure it's worth the price I was charged. 
My best advice is get more cabanas on the roof too and not just by the pool.
I would up hospitality, and welcoming guest's should be more. I booked on Easter weekend and the dates I had I couldn't book at my usual stays which is the W hotel and Hotel 1
I'll say the maids clean up ok.

tripadvisor,"This was the WORST ever hotel I have ever been to. Listing on room on Expedia said in room massages and I picked a room with a terrace. When I checked in I asked the front desk to set up couple massages. She said we don’t have that available. I showed her on my phone the room on Expedia and where it said that. She took a picture of my phone and said it is Expedia fault that they listed that. I called Expedia told them what had happened and they called the hotel and the manager ILA told them yes we do to tell them to tell me to come down to the front desk to see her and she will set it up. I went down she told me that there is a outside company that comes in. She asked for my number and told me it is $140 a person I said awesome it was 9pm Saturday night so she said she would call me tomorrow morning to set it up I said that works out perfect since Sunday is my anniversary. I planned room service breakfast on the terrace than in room couple massages. I went to the room to settle in I was exhausted me and my husband ordered pizza from papa johns now 10pm. They came to the hotel to deliver it the front desk told him I was not a guest of the hotel. So now 12am I call papa johns they tell me the whole story they deliver the pizza 1am I have to get dressed and meet them out on Collins ave so ridiculous . No
Terrace no balcony just walls and dirty windows seriously you can’t see clearly out of them they are filthy. The massage company never called Sunday so I went to front desk again they said they don’t offer again. I called Expedia again they called hotel again this time they said no they don’t. So frustrating. If I knew that they did not have massages or a terrace I would of not booked in this hotel. The room type they offer I could book a $100 room with no amenities. I received a email this is from Expedia and Boulan 

Kindly note that we have contacted the hotel and they advised that the In-room massage is available but they don't offer it from their end, they only have the massage table and tools and you have to order the message yourself & massage people come to the hotel, also advised that this room type we don't promote with balcony, you can request it but not guaranteed depending on availability.

tripadvisor,"Booked 2 King Suites for 8 nights arriving late on May 6th after a delayed flight from New York. We were apprehensive having read some poor reviews but were pleasantly surprised after a less than great experience at the Parker Hotel New York. We had two beautiful rooms/suites, about 1,000 sq ft in size, on the 5th floor next to the gym and opposite the lift to the pool one floor up. The suites were enormous and reasonably well appointed with Kitchen, oven, micro, dishwasher, laundry facilities, two TV's, large dining table+ four chairs, easy seating area, loads of kitchen cupboards and storage, twin w.h.b.'s. large shower, bath and two toilets but no balcony. This was no problem as we were so close to the roof top pool. The Metro bus stop was almost outside the door so only a $2.25 twenty minute bus transfer from the airport to the hotel.The Boulan provided two sun loungers and towels at the beach the umbrella was $15 extra.. All the staff were great and helpful contrary to some reviews.  The free breakfast in the Orange Blossom was really good but not big enough but again with good friendly staff. . We would highly recommend the Boulan Suites but don't expect a lavish reception or lounge area, that is saved for your room if you get one like our two rooms.Expect the $35 a day service and tax fee which is a lot but the free breakfast makes up for that.The rooms were a lot of luxury for the price although one room was more tired than the other.

I was travelling alone so I appreciated the friendliness of the staff who actually used my name from the minute I arrived, a little touch but a nice one.  

One thing that let the hotel down was that the beach they advertise as a private beach is actually a public beach where I actually had my handbag stolen, although loungers were provided by the hotel, umbrella hire cost $15 dollars per day .

I read a few reviews about unfriendly staff, old beat up rooms and furniture and a pool that was not usable. I was a bit worried. We have been visiting SB since 2005 and usually stayed on Ocean Drive. We were greeted by the friendliest Bell Hop upon arrival, and then a very kind and cheerful man named Anthony at check-in. Most boutique hotels in Miami are located in historical buildings that are older. We found the same to be true at Boulan. There were obvious projects happening (power washing of a courtyard on ground level, some painting in hall areas), but nothing that took away from our comfort or the charm of this place. The location was so convenient. When you exit the hotel, you turn right, cross over Collins Ave and hit the Beach straight ahead. There were a number of delicious restaurants doors away from Boulan. We were introduced to ice cream at Kith, amazing Italian food at Sylvanos, the best veal meatballs I have ever had at Blossom, all by Anthony the manager of Boulan and the man that checked us in. This trip was so good for our family. The weather was great, we got to know the neighborhood so much better due to not staying on Ocean Drive. OUR ROOM WAS GINORMOUS and so clean. I will post photos. I am super grateful that we booked this hotel. The pool was so modern, very spacious and clean. Also nice and warm. Plenty of room for lounging and I saw no areas that were under construction.

tripadvisor,"We just stayed at the Boulan for a few days. We had two rooms of different categories so I had a chance to see what was good and bad in both of them.

Overall the space is very nice: large rooms, massive bathrooms, a very nice pool on the roof (with sun all day long). 

The main problem with the hotel is that it is a conversion from an apartment block. This means that the rooms where actually apartments individually owned. This shows in the fact that there is a clear inconsistency between the rooms in terms of furniture.

Furthermore, you can see that very little has been invested in maintaining the original standard of the fittings so if you look past the 'first impression' you notice of lot of marks, broken things, chipped furniture, etc. You get the feeling that the owners are stringing the hotel along until they will have to do a proper refurb and update/upgrade.

The place is reasonably clean but not squeaky clean. Some people complain about the smell in the common areas: it's kind of a strange smell which is not bad but the problem is that it overlays a base smell of 'dirt'; It's a bit like when someone with body odour puts on perfume!

The breakfast and food from the affiliated restaurant is good quality and the portions are generous. The place is small so you may have to wait in the morning to get a table.

Staff is friendly and helpful I think mainly because they have to deal with quite a lot of small complaints about things not working or being broken. Shout out for Kevin and Pierre who were very polite and helpful.

I would probably go somewhere else next time but the standard on that stretch of Collins Avenue (apart from the Setai) is pretty hit and miss.

If they invested in fixing all the inconsistencies and broken/missing bits and pieces it would be a very nice property.",8.0,Matt Food & Wine Lover,2019-04-11,,Family,7.4,1201

Bedding for 2 adults only!
Open sleeper couch, badly broken and looks like it was broken for awhile...so they put a family of 4 in a room knowing the sleeper couch was broken. Called reception to report broken couch and lack of bedding. Was asked it I wanted a baby cot??? I replied that I have a 13 yr old and 4 year old how would they fit in a baby cot? Was told I would be called back once an alternate room was found.

Called back and told that we are being sent a rollaway bed, bed set up by maintenance who told us to call again for bedding. So call reception and remind the receptionist that we have 2 children,  going out to dinner to please arrange for the rollaway bed to be made up and to fix TV in bedroom. Return from dinner 2 hours later, TV not attended to and 1 pillow on rollaway bed??? Call reception again and request another pillow and blanket. Housekeeping arrive with 1 pillow no blanket.

As our flight from Montreal was at 7am, we decided to have an adventure and used the TriRail system and bus to get to the hotel.  Needless to say, we still arrived much earlier than expected (2:30pm - check in time is from 4pm onwards) and the staff were nothing but welcoming and accommodating.  Our luggage was whisked away to a secure area for temporary storage and we were given a glass of wine and an invitation to relax and that our luggage would be taken up to the room when it was available.  We waited approximately 20-30 minutes and we then proceeded to check in.   Eva was very thorough at explaining the various charges (ie: what was included in our stay and what would be considered as an extra charge if we took advantage of the extra items) and the whole process was quick and efficient.   Once we got to our room, we were delighted as it was a 1 bed King Suite in beautiful condition.  I am a die hard foodie and the kitchen in room 212 was beyond fantastic - Miele appliances everywhere ;-)   The 2 bathrooms were perfect for my sister and I and we loved the marble that was everywhere.  Housekeeping came in every day without issue and they always made sure to leave plenty of fresh towels etc...   We did have an issue with the temperature in the unit on one day when the weather tanked due to a cold front/storm that rolled through on  December 20 and we had trouble getting the temperature at a level we preferred.  A quick call to the front desk and maintenance was up shortly afterwards and the situation resolved as all rooms have their own temperature control and have numerous options.  The hotel is on the corner of Collins and 21st and it was so accessible as we were able to catch the free Trolley or city bus whenever we wanted. Check out was a breeze and again, Giselle took the time to review the charges we had during our stay (just the $30 resort fee) and the security deposit was quickly returned to my credit card by Monday (today).

tripadvisor,"our flight was delayed so we arrived at the hotel at almost midnight..  the room was nothing like what we expected ..it was dirty and there was a blood stain on the pull out couch mattress (which was incredibly uncomfortable)  there weren't enough pillows for the four of us and after waiting until almost 1:30am they were able to ""locate"" one more pillow from a "" neighboring "" hotel...
we ended up getting a roll away bed for the rest of the stay ..not as comfortable as we had hoped for but definitively better than the couch
the door handles on the closet and the bathroom were broken and even tho they said they would fix it they never did 
the shower was disgusting looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks 
Anthony the manager was very quick to promise us he would ""take care of us"" by either moving us to another room or taking care of the issues we had but he never did anything 
we booked the room for 4 people but only got breakfast and beach chairs for two...they advertise a ""private beach"" which is not at all what they have ..it is the public beach where you pay for extra chairs($20per day per chair) and umbrellas($15)  
there are NO services 
they send you to a restaurant around the corner for breakfast but it is small and really crowded we had to wait an average of 30 minutes every morning 
we had paid in advance which was the only reason why we didn't leave 
it is at best a 3 star hotel NOT the 4or 5 star hotel they advertise

tripadvisor,"So let me start with how the staff is very nice and friendly and overall the hotel is laid out well and feels spacious. 
We booked the king suite and because we wanted laundry in the unit we upgraded to the 1 bedroom suite. The u it is very well laid out and it is very spacious. 
Now for the negative, the door upon walking in slammed behind us like a train hit the wall, door Machanism doesn’t work well, walls everywhere had wear marks like they were scuffed with things, near the bedroom walls, the directv box was just sitting on top of the tv and fell either in the back of the tv or in front of the tv, the remote in the living area beryl worked unless you sit in funky positions, a piece of baseboard was missing by the bedroom door, the bathroom door in the master would not stay closed, unless you locked it and then upon unlocking it would not release from the wall plate/latch and the locking plate would pull out of the wall or it would feel like you are just locked in the bathroom, the bathroom is nice but I don’t want to be locked in it.. The master shower head needs a good cleaning as it had lots of calcium on it, this is after I figured out the hot valve is for cold water and the cold is for hot. 
We went food shopping and upon loading the food we noticed the fridge was not cooling, or making ice. I turned the fridge on and off, figured housekeeping or maintenance turned it off maybe? But after turning it on and off a few times it came on and started cooking. No ice at all, I asked the front desk and no one came up to even look and see why there is no ice. I tried the ice switch and even after 4 days still no ice or anyone to look at the issue. Then while cooking I tried to turn on the  exhaust fan and it just didn’t work, checked to make sure it’s plugged in, light worked on it but no exhaust fan. While looking under the hood I noticed it was just filthy.. 
then I said let me open the windows, guess what, the crank to open the windows were all missing, bedroom window had a latch you lift and the window would just push open. 
This window in the bedroom opened but the rest would not. 1 out of 3 I guess is not bad. 
The kitchen utensils are dollar store quality, not that I’m expecting gold but geez, I dont remember last time I even saw such cheap kitchen equipment and utensils. The pots and pans, 2 to be exact were completely scratched and unusable, thank god for wax paper.. 
Mini bar is ridiculous, 8$ for a bottle of water? 
2 Coffee capsules are included even though they have 6 capsules there for you and apparently they are not included in your room rate, we found this out after we checked out not a big deal but man I’ve been in lots of places and never been nickel and dimes everywhere you go. 
 Garbage shoot and room was outside our room about 2 doors down and as you’re walking by you can smell it in the hallway. 
I will not stay here again. 

Pool area is nice, again looks very used.. is have more to say but I’m running out of space.. 
not sure I’d stay here again because of the quality of cleanliness and poor maintenance.",6.0,EAS2019,2019-02-18,,Couple,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"From the website this hotel seems beautiful. It is a very nice boutique hotel but it certainly does not justify its price. It would have been nice to know that they were renovating. Lots of areas were dirty and dusty. The outside ""Zen Garden"" that they claimed to have was unavailable and under construction. And in reality is just a fountain and some chairs and a large table. Nothing so Zen about that. It's just a patio. The lobby walls were gross. Parts of it were spackled. Most disappointing was the pool and hot tub area, which is actually the only real amenity they have. The area was dirty. There were cigarette butts on the ground (which I told them about). The hot tub was not working at all - I don't get that. That is a major amenity! Many of the lounge beds were ripped or dirty and were not all covered by clean ""towel sheets"".

Our luggage did not arrive with us on our flight and was delayed until the evening and they rushed to get us into a room even though it was not yet check in time. That being said, there were a few problems with our stay. The fire alarm went off in the hotel twice in the week we were there. We had to evacuate and wait until the fire department gave the all clear to return. Valet parking is a little expensive at around $35 a day otherwise you have to find a parking spot on the street which, if you’ve ever been to South Beach, you know how hard that can be. The rooftop pool is nice but small. The gym really cannot even be called a gym. It is more like a room with 2 treadmills, one of which was not working, and a few weights.

tripadvisor,"Incident on the night of Thursday 22nd November 2018. 
Just before midnight my Husband and I were woken by the screams of two people who we assumed were cleaners or staff or intruders due to the ridiculous time of night. My husband screamed ""Hello"" from the bedroom which petrified them and they ran off leaving all the lights on. The next morning I went to speak with reception and asked for a manager and a lady approached me to explain the incident was far worse than I imagined... They actually gave keys to our room to two RANDOM PEOPLE CHECKING IN... I'm sure these people were as traumatised as we were but the manager was not very sympathetic and simply offered only an apology for a situation that could have been far worse. Our personal belongings were everywhere including jewelry, money etc and it could have been stolen or we could have ended up in a fight with these people as we thought they were intruders. I have been to many hotels in many countries and this has never happened before.

Despite the above I will still provide some useful feedback regarding Boulan South Beach as some aspects were half decent.

The good:
- HUGE Room, Living Space and Bathroom
- 2nd Spare Toilet
- Full kitchen with Oven, Microwave, Grill, Fridge and Freezer, Toaster (did not have Kettle had to ask reception to provide)
- Friendly staff especially Tony who manages the rooftop Pool area. Tony is the only reason I didn't give two stars to be honest he is amazing and extremely helpful. 
- Rainfall Shower is amazing and goes super hot on highest temperature.
- Washer, dryer very useful too.
- Iron and ironing board provided.
- Pool area is amazing and the hot tub was also amazing especially at night time, towels also provided here which was useful.
- Beach towels and sun beds provided on the beach by friendly staff.

The bad:
- Worst part is the incident described above with no compensation offered or provided despite us having another 4 nights remaining...
- We paid extra for a terraced room and received a tiny balcony made smaller with overgrown trees which also blocked the sun and attracted bugs
- On 2nd floor the traffic and amazing cars can be heard constantly (not helpful if you're a light sleeper)
- Some days our snacks were restocked other days they weren't, it was very random and a little annoying.
- Dishwasher old and doesn't clean very well, I had to hand wash most items even after the cleaners put them in the dishwasher.
- Not much cutlery, towels and Bathroom soap/shampoos etc provided and when finished weren't replaced in timely manner. Shower gel was not replaced at all after the first.
- Cleaners seemed to get lazy over time as our bedding was not changed everyday or even every 2 days and I had to change it myself with the spare.
- Our towels were changed everyday up until our 7th night where they just hung up the same towels... My makeup from the night before was still on it! 
- Upon leaving we were met with a large mini bar bill which was expected, what we didn't expect was the insane service charge tax thing they add on considering the service from the cleaners were barely satisfactory. For the total amount we spent at this hotel I wish I had booked the Loews nearby.

Overall, I expected a lot more for what I paid and generally the experience was completely ruined by the incident above. I've also seen people mention that they got refurbished rooms, I can definitely say ours was not one of them and really could do with some TLC. 

One thing i have to say is a big thanks to Tony for being so kind and helpful to us every day. We stayed here for 9 nights total and I am a little traumatised and there are a lot of bad points. From my profile you will see I very rarely give below 4 and I do not complain often but some lines were crossed here...

What i do not understand (and kind of irritates me) is why they ask you to pay extra 15 bucks for an umbrella on the beach, when you are already required to pay 30+ bucks a day as a ""resort fee"" .

tripadvisor,"We stayed for a week M-F in a one bedroom standard suite w/ kitchen on be second floor. Not much of a view to be completely honest, there was construction going on in front of our balcony so all you saw was the deteriorating building but no big deal to us. The room was nice and updated, we had 2 bathrooms and one shower (no tub fyi). The shower was see-through glass, no curtains but there were glass sliding doors for privacy in the bathroom and bedroom areas if needed. Bed was comfortable too, can’t complain. 
The pool was nice although pictures are a little deceiving. The area is not as big as it seems. They have limited chairs and cabanas so you kind of have to get there early or you’ll end up in the grass area vs the pool. They do however provide you with towels, sunblock and they have a water jar which is nice. 
The beach is literally across the street, which was great. There, they will provide you with chairs and towels but the umbrella was $15, which no one mention but again no big deal to us. 
One thing I would say is DO NOT touch the mini bar. Look at the prices before you grab anything thinking it’s free. We drank 2 small waters which ended up costing us $5 each.

tripadvisor,"We stayed for three nights in a one bedroom deluxe suite (located on the penthouse floor) with my husband and two teenage sons. Having spent hours researching hotels in SOBE, I felt these serviced apartments offered the best value for money for a decent standard of accommodation. And I still feel this way. There were a couple of glitches  - we had a late arrival after a long day's travel and the sofa bed was not made up.  Security delivered the sheets but no pillows and when I asked for them, the response was that was unlikely to be possible. Security did show up half an hour later with them but by then, we were all exhausted. We also found that kitchen utensils were removed by housekeeping and not replaced so we were left short of some basic amenities. My husband requested a glass be brought to the room but it never arrived. The sofa bed was also fairly uncomfortable - my boys were ready to get back into a proper bed. We also had a wide balcony but it was not furnished so rendered it fairly useless. These were all minor inconveniences which I feel could be easily rectified.  The apartment was a good size and well furnished (inside). We very much enjoyed the beach area which was a short stroll away and the rooftop pool was great. We also appreciated having a gym on-site.

tripadvisor,"Booked the Boulan hotel specifically based on their good reviews online, their location, and their apartment style rooms with kitchens. While the location was very good, the traffic outside of the hotel will keep you up at night. Upon arriving our fridge was broken and could not keep anything cold. After informing the front desk and maintenance of this on our 2nd day, we were not contacted nor was anything done until the 4th day of our stay. All the groceries we had bought on our first day were spoiled, and we were forced to spend money at restaurants eating out. After our 3rd complaint about the fridge we spoke to the manager in person who did not switch our room, or provide a discount on our hotel room, but gave a $50 credit at the hotel restaurant. He told us he could have switched us to a different room but it would have been a downgrade, yet we were still forced to pay for the amenities of a luxury room even though they were were broken until our last day. 

Still had a fun time in south beach, but it was definitely not because of the Boulan. I would highly recommend looking elsewhere!",4.0,Alec S,2018-09-11,,Couple,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"My sister and I stayed at the Boulan South Beach for a few nights. Id firstly like to thank the staff for being so welcoming and attentive to our needs. Such as, front desk agents Giselle and Vicky who were so helpful and kind throughout our entire stay. We also had the pleasure to meet the front desk manager Marvin who was also very hospitable and kind. We were greeted and served by three wonderful bellmen who assisted to our needs and allowed for easy travels. Such as bellmen; Danny, Mike, & Felipe. They ensured our comfort throughout our stay and always greeted us with waters upon arrival from the beach. We received great recommendations for all of the staff on what there is to see in the area and go to spots, they were very well informed with their surroundings and they're indications were very helpful. They really made us feel important and appreciated throughout our stay. 

As for the rooms, We had the pleasure of staying in two room types throughout our stay. We firstly slept in a Standard King room which was clean, spacious, yet cozy. I cannot complain about anything. They had the room decorated in modern furniture and fixtures. Although we also had the chance to spend our other nights in their two bedroom King Deluxe Suite. There was obviously a huge different in size of the rooms, despite the quality and cleanliness of these room type didn't not differ. The housekeeping was consistent with the cleaning of our rooms, as well as towel replenishment and neatness throughout every morning. The bathrooms were spotless and I felt like I was home for how clean and well kept the rooms were. I did not hesitate to walk bear foot in the rooms. As for the suite it was fully equipped with a full kitchen as well a dishwasher which we had the chance to use for our dinners. The living space in the suite was wonderful and spacious allowing the possibility of inviting guest to your suite or sleep a large family. There was a washing machine and dryer found in the room to our disposal and allowed us to clean our clothing throughout the stay. The room also allowed access to a large private balcony which was the perimeter of the entire suite. Location of the hotel was fantastic, we walked everywhere and did not need to order Ubers. We were steps away from a private beach area where we were accompanied by hotel staff with a shuttle and were given beach chair upon arrival.

My sister and I are very high maintenance and this hotel accommodated to all of our needs and desires. The Boulan exceeded our expectations and created a memorable experience.

The couch had multiple rips, the bar stools were worn and the fabric was splitting and another chair in the living room was worn and in poor quality. One of our blackout curtains in our bedroom was also ripped and the ironing board was broken. 

The staff was very nice but when we checked in, we were not given any information about the beach chairs or the pool. We had to ask. It would also have been nice to know that the umbrellas were extra prior to going down to the beach. We had no idea that room service was available or that there was a gym.

The room was very nice, spacious, clean with one of the most comfortable beds we've experienced to date. Very roomy bathroom with large tub and shower.

We had a great experience with staff from valet including Christian and the guest services especially dealing with Eva and Yalexis. They always smiled and were very attentive at check-in, check-out and helping us with a few requests. 

The beach is excellent and very clean and the guys at the beach provided excellent service. Special thanks to Jesus and his crew from Boucher Brothers, a company that takes care of sunbeds and towel services. Note that while sunbeds and towels are included, umbrellas and cabanas are extra. At the time, it was $15/day for an umbrella and $20/day for a cabana.

tripadvisor,"I stayed at the Boulan for 7 days with my partner. We wanted a nice relaxing holiday close to the beach. This hotel was perfect! We had such a great time, I would come back any time. 

We were quiet excited about the apartments, as we actually expected a room. But instead we got this huge apartment, which was just amazing. We felt like in heaven!
We had a huge bathroom with 2 sinks, an extra toilet, even a washing machine and a tumble dryer. A huge couch and a super comfortable bed. This apartment had 2 TV's. Actually to much to ask for. It was amazing. And not to forget a huge balcony. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. You got a valet parking for 40 dollars per night. We had a rental for 2 days, so we used the valet. Very nice staff there as well. 

We booked the apartment with breakfast. The breakfast was served at a restaurant around the corner called orange blossom. It was amazing. The breakfast was very tasteful. We went there quiet often also for dinner or lunch. They had the best pasta we had in a long time. I can highly recommend that restaurant. 

The pool looks bigger on the pictures though than in reality, but it was ok. We are more beach people so we didn't mind that really. Nice for dip after the beach. 

The location was great as well. Just a few minutes walk to Lincoln Road or Ocean Drive. Crossing the road and you are at the beach, where sunbed were included.

We were really really happy with that choice of the hotel and it was definitely worth the money. I highly recommend that hotel.",8.0,Alex_kfm,2018-07-08,,Couple,7.4,1201

We had payed all fees before checking in, including taxes. However when we checked out, we were charged once again. The balcony door in the room was locked, or perhaps, stuck. There was also a storage room(we suppose) in the room, locked, too. We called the front desk and they told us they’d send technicians here, but no one came during the four night of our stay. We had already put up the sign to inform them not to disturb, but they still came in and took the tips without cleaning the room. We booked the room for 4 people, but all essentials we need turned out to be only for 2. They charged a 600 dollars incident fee which they promised to return after checking out, but the money never came back. The advertisements were fake by saying they had free WiFi. However the WiFi did not work AT ALL. The sofa bed was broken and they only replaced it with a roll up bed. How are we supposed to sleep? There were too many unhappy experiences throughout our stay and we DO NOT recommend this hotel at all.

tripadvisor,"We stayed at the boulan for four days in June.  Check in was very slow and took forever and they had to refund me my hotel costs and then repay on another as the card I’d used to pay had been renewed since. They then didn’t processs the payment as requested but it got resolved in the end, just not ideal after a long flight and then transfer from London. 

Anayway after that we finally got to our room and it was amazing. The sofa was great and kitchen looked brand new. It has two toilets and the main bathroom has a big walk in shower with good pressure. The bedroom was okay. The bed has a leather surround which was showing a lot of tearing etc and probably needs replacing to keep a high end feel. 

We had breakfast included and it was well worth doing that as you have it at a restaurant around the corner, the orange tree,  and the food is amazing. They also provide the in room dining and have really good dinner offers

The hotel is just a short walk from the beach and bars and restaurants so location is great. 

There is a pool on the roof but given how hot it was it was like getting in a bath. Would be nice if they’d could offer a cold pool in summer. 

Overall a good stay and somewhere we’d consider staying again if we went to Miami but would see about getting a room with balcony as we had no outside space and our view was of a building site.",8.0,wiffy0,2018-07-21,,Couple,7.4,1201

It was supposed to be 100 sq ft bigger. The ocean view is extremely laughable. It's a crack between 2 hotels that you can see the ocean if you are on the right angle.

The location is a great location because it’s about a block away from the beach and also very close to all dining on Collins avenue. Be ready to spend $40/night on valet, i think this is becoming the new norm in most places. The only issue I had was that the staff at the desk weren’t enthusiastic at all, they were “blan” if that makes any sense. (2 young females) The Latino man who carried the bags and helped staff was very nice and friendly.  We got there early at about 12 pm and i knew our room wouldn’t be ready, but we wait over 4 hours for our room. Yes gurenteed check in was at 4pm, but even still there had to have been some rooms available. They did give us a larger room which we appreciated, this was even before we knew we had to wait. While we waited we had complementary seats / umbrella at the beach and then we also had access to the pool on the rooftop. It was very relaxing. I would just suggest that maybe a staff memeber be up there to offer food and drinks. I did notice a bar off to the other side of the roof but it was closed. Maybe they only open at night and weekends.

I must say, our stay was AMAZING!!! The hotel staff greeted me with a warm welcome and asked to assist with my 1pc of luggage. 

I walked into the room and it was simply beautiful. Exactly what I expected for a South Beach Hotel. The room looked just like the pictures on the website.

Our room was clean. The Balcony was clean.

I have only 1 complaint about our balcony. We only had a pair of upright wicker chairs but no table. It would have been great if there was at least 1 lounger and a small table for placing drinks and other whatnot's.

I loved the kitchen and dining area. I am a sucker for a great hotel. 

The sectional sofa was so comfortable and sturdy. We watched the NBA playoffs and dosed off on the sofa. 

We had a mishap with our bed and maintenance fixed it without question. 

Slept in beyond the housekeeping service time. They sent a team up to our room for cleaning. They even washed the dishes that were left in the sink.

The service at the hotel was consistently pleasant.  

It rained the entire time we were there so we spent most of our time in the hotel room. The room reminds me of a 1 bedroom apartment with a HUGE bathroom. 

We didn't get a chance to experience the Zen Garden or the Pool because of the rain. I will definitely return to the Boulan. The location is perfect.",10.0,snobbytrvlgrl,2018-05-29,,Solo,7.4,1201

Some people on TripAdvisor were complaining about pool cleanness. I don’t agree with them. The pool is really nice, located on the top of building. There are some sofas, sunbeds, chairs and so on (for free). As a guest of Boulan Hotel you can also get the sunbeds and towels on the beach - complimentary (which is great because the regular price is at least 10$ per person). Hotel is located approx 200 m from the public beach, there you will find these sunbeds for hotel guests.

What I can complain is a bed - very big but for sure too soft. You can feel on this bed like on hammock, which is not good for the full night.

The hotel breakfast is served in the restaurant outside the hotel. The same building, but to get there you have to walk 50 meters along the street. Sometimes you have to wait for a table outside the restaurant. The breakfasts for hotel guests (prebooked and paid in advance) are rather small. They offer a few options, like e.g.: 2 eggs with toast or smoked salomon with a bagel. You can order a coffee or a juice but not both, unless you want to pay extra. 

The staff in this hotel is really nice and helpfull. You can check-out at 11 am and still use the pool at the roof or the sunbeds on the beach.

Pro's: Good location within walking distance of most attractions and amenities. Clean and spacious rooms. Very nice kitchenette and amenities. Rooftop pool was a nice feature, although pool lounge chairs were at a premium.

Con's: Upon arrival, bellman was covering front desk. Upon registration clerk's arrival, was not informed of restaurant, specials, VIP benefits, WiFi password, or other amenities associated with hotel. AC stopped working my last evening, but it was fairly comfortable for the night. Poor room location as nightclub/bar was right outside and adjacent to terrace window.

At the beach, they had chairs for Boulan and you could rent umbrellas and  cabanas.

 The hotel had some nice features like the pool on the top floor.  The picture of the pool on their website is accurate, though the room picture was definitely not our room. The bar area up by the pool was not open when we were there, though there was a server who would run and get things if you ordered. 

Our room was odd.  There was the front room that was big and open ... for no particular reason.  There was a kitchenette area but no table to eat on, though there was room for one. There was a hard leather sofa (not a pullout) and chair and that's about it. The room also had  a HUGE balcony (see picture) with one small table and a chair... and dead plants that lined the street-side planters. Again, potential not met.

The bed and bath were nice enough...not roomy but comfortable.

tripadvisor,"We stayed at the Boulan Hotel for five nights during spring break with our 2 teenage kids and had a great vacation.
Because of some misunderstandings in our reservation that was made via the hotel website, Marvin Suarez, the hotel manager resolved it to our great satisfaction.
Our room was amazing, spacious and more then adequately accommodated our family of four; it was a great living space to come back to after a long day at the beach.  It greatly enhanced our overall vacation.
The food at their restaurant Orange Blossom was also a major hit.  The accompanying breakfast was delicious, a wide variety of choices offered.  We found ourselves having more meals there than originally planned because the food was so good.
I highly recommend Boulan because of its location, the staff and manager, all of whom were extremely helpful and attentive; and because of the accommodations.
We look forward to coming back to Boulan in the future.

tripadvisor,"My husband and I booked a weekend getaway. We arrived in the morning hoping a room would be available but were told check in was at 4. The woman who checked us in was not very friendly and acted as though we were bothering her. We asked if there was a place to change and were told there was a bathroom around the corner. A room to change would have been really nice but regardless we changed and checked our bags with the bellhop who was extremely helpful and friendly. He explained how to get to the pool. We arrived at the pool to find not a single open seat. The area is very nice but everyone is on top of each other.  They could use more lounge chairs in the sitting area outside the pool area. 

We then decided to walk to the hotel’s private beach which was a couple of blocks away. It’s a very nice area with lounge chairs and towels. We received a phone call at 3:30 that our room was ready so we walked back to officially check in. The woman who actually checked us in was very friendly. We got to our room and were very happy with the room. We had a nice balcony partially covered (which was very useful the next day when it rained).  There was a kitchen and nice space. 

There was only a sheer curtain in the bathroom which was surprising not to have complete privacy in the bathroom. Our A/C stopped working in the middle of the night our first night. We tried calling down to the front desk but the phone wouldn’t work. We had a hard time sleeping and were extremely warm all night. In the morning we called the hotel from our cell and they sent someone right up to fix the A/C. We asked about ice and since they don’t have a public ice machine they said they’d send someone up with ice. He came right away.  

We did pass on adding the breakfast option at the Orange Blossom when we booked our room because we hate being tied to one place but in retrospect we loved the breakfast place and ate there each morning so wish we had added it. It rained off and on in the afternoon our second day so since Orange Blossom had a Happy Hour special and 20% off for those staying at the Boulan we decided to stay close and try it out. The drinks were extremely weak and filled to the top with ice, the dinner was just ok and upon receiving the bill were told they couldn’t give us 20% because we had the happy hour special. I kindly asked that they separate the drinks from the bill as that was not indicated anywhere. The dinner/drink service was very slow and disappointing.  Highly recommend the place for breakfast/brunch but stay away for dinner.",6.0,Redhawksskins,2018-04-08,,Couple,7.4,1201

However, a few things were definitely off - our room lacked a full length mirror (though I believe some of the rooms do have them), and towels seemed hard to come by.  For two people, we were given two small bath towels, one hand towel, and one washcloth.  Also, we were below the gym, and on one morning, someone was dropping weights LOUDLY before the gym was to open at 8am.

tripadvisor,"I have stayed in many different hotels, from 2 star to 5 star, but this by far was the worst experience I have ever had. DO NOT stay at the Boulan.

I stayed at Boulan in February 2018 with my child.

1. On the first day we arrived, we were put up in a hotel room that was UNFINISHED; it looked like it had been half renovated and finished in a hurry - the walls were half painted, the paint was chipped, there was construction dust covering the entire room. The kitchen table was chipped and there was a cigarette burn on the couch. The microwave did not work and there was a giant hole burnt into the wall of the microwave. The safe did not work. When I complained they said they were ""out of rooms"" and instead sent a technician to attempt to replace the microwave and fix the safe, rather than move us. Finally, upon my insistence, we moved rooms. I consider the conditions of this first room to be extremely unsafe and was appalled that they would even consider putting a guest up in that kind of condition, that too one with a child.
2. Our second room continued to have defects. There was a huge hole in the couch with upholstery coming out. Also, there was only one phone in the room and it did not work. I had to call down to reception on my cellphone to ask someone to come fix the phone, and incurred long distance charges. I would have gone down in person but had a child with me. I was told someone would come right away. Half an hour later nobody had come. I called again and was told they did not receive the first call! By that time my child was asleep and I had to wait until the next morning to call again. THREE long distance calls on my cellphone were incurred due to their negligence.
3. There were two of us in the room but we were given only ONE bath towel. Again, I called to complain. The response I received was the ""clean linens had not yet arrived!"" (this was AFTERNOON, mind you). I proceeded to take a shower and share my childs towel; while in the  middle of a shower, someone from the hotel entered the room and deposited towels on the bed!!! It was incredibly unsettling and uncomfortable to know someone had entered my bedroom when I was in the shower only a few feet away and likely in full view. If they knocked and there was no answer. surely upon entering the room they would hear a running shower and I assume use common sense and leave the towels in the living area instead.
4. There is a rooftop pool, however there was no attendant and no towels at the pool in the early afternoon.
5. They have a designated beach area and advertise that beach toys are available; we asked the beach attendant for toys, they said they would have to look for them; one and a half hours later we had not heard back, and only upon approaching the attendant did I find out that there are no beach toys.
6. They advertise free wifi, however the wifi did not work in my room. 
7. When checking out at 10:30am I called down to ask for a bellboy to help with our bags. I was alone with a child and a stroller and therefore really needed the help. The front desk picked up my call, however immediately put me on hold before I could speak. After a 10 minute wait, I hung up and called again - only to be put on hold without being able to speak again. By then 15 minutes had passed and we were going to be late for our flight. I had no choice but to take my bag and my child and my stroller down on my own or else risk missing my flight.
8. The overall experience was terrible, however what bothered me the most was that when I complained about my stay I did not get an apology - just a head nod from the lady at the front desk. Is this customer service?

Pros: Big room, full kitchen, and free breakfast at the restaurant next door. There is potential but the way it is run detracts from any of the potential ""pros"".

tripadvisor,"Overall, our experience was positive.  Mostly because the staff upgraded us to the Penthouse suite......just for the asking.  I suppose they upgraded us because we arrived early (11:30am) and our room wasn't ready until 5pm.  Nevertheless, we knew we'd be waiting and called ahead to make sure we could use the pool, etc. (which we could and did!)  
I was concerned, however, that whenever we were in the lobby (small lobby) people seemed to be having difficulties.....whether it was delayed check in or a line to check out.....none of the guests seemed  particularly happy.  Also, the jacuzzi wasn't working and the workers were there using power tools on it.
The rooftop view is beautiful and the pool is nice.  Certainly worth saving all of that money by not being at one of those pricier hotels like the Delano or Setai or even Lowes.  Would recommend.",8.0,Ann M,2018-03-02,,Couple,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"The best part of Boulan South Beach is the beachfront!! Two chairs and towels come along with the rooms. Sebastian, Diana, Micheal and the beachfront team are very warm and hardworking. The combination of the water, sun and their friendliness really makes you feel like you’ve arrived at the destination where the bliss of vacation really begins.

The hotel has been invested in and designed* to do well. It needs more consistent and passionate management, especially in housekeeping and maintenance. There were so many things not properly working or stocked. Unnecessary hassles.
I’m hopeful that some shifts here can help it live up to its full potential. Still, a good time was had.

Orange Blossom has a good breakfast. We recommend ordering at the door to go and eating on the beachfront beneath a cabana. It’s often crowded with aggressive tourists in the morning.
If you want to take your time and people watch over breakfast I recommend News Cafe. It’s open to the outdoors and less tense than Orange Blossom. 

The citi bike stand just outside the entrance is very useful. It’s a great way to look around the full stretch of South Beach. The closeness of the Bass Museum is also a great plus.

The one bedroom at Boulan is a joy if you know where to get your nicknacks from, like Alton Shopping Center or Lincoln Square. Collect your vices so that a night in is a real joy.

tripadvisor,"I was in Miami for work in January and had selected the property for it's central location on Collins and was not disappointed. The location made it easy to walk to the beach, nearby shops, parks, etc... 

The supervisor (Markus I believe) was wonderful and accommodating. The room size, spacing, design, and amenities all exceeded my expectations. The only negative (which applies to most of Miami) was the cost of parking and that it was a garage around the block.

tripadvisor,I took my sister there for her 40th bday.   We only had 3 bath towels in room.   Nothing else.   Had to keep asking and they would only give me 3 new bath towels because I only had 3 people in room.  I didn't pay that much money to have towels rationed!!  The light was out on bathroom mirror.  I had to ask twice to get it fixed and they never could figure it out!  Pool area was a mess and hot pool was disgusting.   Pull out couch was horrible to sleep on.    As we were leaving it took forever to get bags and the woman at the desk was curt.

tripadvisor,"We stayed here for 11 nights. There are both good and bad things to say about this hotel.

+
The rooms are big.
Pool area and gym are great.
The location close to south beach.
Laundry equipment in the rooms.

-
The bed in the main bedroom is really comfortable but the bed sofa is horrible. Ours was even broken upon arrival so we got two other beds instead.

There rooms have both a stove and oven but the overall lack of cooking equipment makes it impossible to cook your own food. There isn't even enough glasses and plates for four persons (which the rooms are made for)

The cleaning service is sloppy, we found both used gloves, dirty dishes and old trash from previous guest in our room.

The included breakfast is not much at all. Just a glass of juice, coffee and a small additional item such as a waffle or a bowl of cereals. Nothing compared to traditional hotel breakfasts.

An avarage hotel. I would not book it again.",6.0,Andreas F,2017-08-22,,Group,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"Room was booked in late July. I phoned up on two occasions to confirm payment had gone through.  They said room was paid for and the only thing I owed was taxes, service charge and incidental fee.  Upon arrival on Friday 11th August they said that the same card used to make original payment had to be used to make remaining payment. I told them this was impossible as the agent who made the booking was in London and this point was not stated when I phoned up, only that I owed taxes and $600 incidental fee. Receptionist was quick to take my credit card when I said this. 

Next morning (Saturday 12th) we went to confirm everything was ok as previous night's receptionist seemed shady. Receptionist told us that original payment is now on hold until person who made original booking is there in person with their card. As this was not possible I said should we just look for an alternative, cheaper hotel as we simply could not afford to pay again. The receptionist (Laura) ridiculed this suggestion and told us to hang in there and that everything will be resolved once the reservation department opened on Monday.  She said all they needed was a credit card authorisation form and even though no one staffs the phones over the weekend, if we emailed them over the weekend they'll respond. Our agent emailed them twice to obtain this form but received no response. On Monday he called them and they not only asked him to complete the authorisation form but also a number of supporting documentations that simply could not be completed, submitted and processed before we checked- out. The receptionist's misrepresentation that ' everything will be OK ' meant that we were now liable for 3 nights stay at the standard tariff for the room, which was a substantially higher cost than was originally paid in our initial booking agreement.

We feel horrified that the receptionist, by influencing us to change our minds in this way and to stay on for two extra days has now not only made us liable to pay for two extra days but also at a vastly inflated rate in addition to having paid for the room already. We feel it is completely unacceptable, misleading and immoral to be charged for the extra nights based on the receptionist's misrepresentation.

Note: inconsistent hotel policy clauses: “the credit card used for booking must be presented at check in”. Not possible – not OK!!
“The name on the credit card must match the name on the reservation” Not the case – but not a problem!!!???
To add insult to injury they debited further money from my credit card I had not authorised after my departure (for a pool umbrella after we left - the pool wasn't even open for the entire duration of our stay and we'd checked out!!).

Additional issues which pale into insignificance in comparison to the above - crumbs on sofa,  food remnants on table, balcony door from living room couldn't open,  balcony door from bedroom couldn't lock- very unsafe so had to carry our valuables with us at all times,  blinds too stiff to open /close, sunbed on balcony warped and wobbling like a rocking chair, majority of drawers in bedroom would not open,  chest of drawers unstable, breakfast was pitiful and even though it says included you need to pay if you want more than one item (which obviously won't fill you up!), room service did not attend to our room on the second day.  In general, atrocious value for money. 

I do not wish the management to “give us the opportunity to show us why Boulan South Beach Hotel is so loved by many” which is given as a flippantly stock response to other reviews by disgruntled guests. The only way to redeem themselves would be to refund us the extra nights that we were made to stay and pay for again.

Please consider all of the above before booking to stay here.",2.0,SuzyBose,2017-08-29,,Couple,7.4,1201

Step outside walk across the street & the beach is right there. Shopping in Miami is always the best. I can usually find things down here I can't find back home. 

The Hotel:
They offer a continental breakfast. Valet parking the door people are always nice. Check in a tad long because we were told the girl at the desk stepped out to go to the store & of course she was the only one there. The rooms are very nice. Ours had a full kitchen.

Do not pay for ocean view room. The hotel is far away from the beach. You will never be able to see the water. Do not waste your money.

Hotel was very nice.  We arrived and did not really know what to expect.  I did know that I was not booking a room but rather a condo.  We did get put in the top floor.  Our suite was one bedroom with two bathrooms and a pull out.  Very spacious and comfortable.  The view was of the street but then we were not near the water.  
We had some issues with the pull out couch.  The second night in it broke probably due to its use over time.  The staff noted it and gave us a rollaway bed.  It was a little small but we kept it and stayed in this particular unit.  
At the end of our stay I did mention that we had to accommodate the hotel(it was fully booked) by staying in the unit.  The staff did not charge me for the daily fee.
I think that this was a great gesture on their part.

tripadvisor,"I have mixed feelings about Boulon. I will say that the location is great. It's close to the beach and they do offer some
Nice things. Beach chairs on the beach, a pool, and an acceptable outside area.  I suppose they are going for a modern art feel. The king suite has a nice kitchen area as well as a nice sitting area as well as a Separate tv in the sleeping area and the sleeping area.

Other than that, I will say it's not what I would have expected for the price and location. The check in took 45 minutes. Slowest check in I have ever experienced. The evening staff members were. It super friendly at the desk but the morning staff seemed much friendlier.

The walls were all quite dirty looking and scuffed. The hotel was filled with mosquitos. In the rooms! I was eaten up each night I was there. Our AC stopped working in the middle of the night. The floors seemed unclean. The bathroom was not super user friendly. Very modern but no place to put any of your personal belongings. 

This place could use a fresh coat of paint and perhaps a staff meeting about smiling to the customers. And perhaps a shelf in each bathroom.

tripadvisor,"This hotel has the potential to be very nice, but the staff just has no sense of accountability. Let me start with my stay at this hotel was unpleasant from the moment I  booked. It started with my confirmation saying that I have a double, but the room that I was given was a King. Luckily it was only 2 of us because that SOFA BED LOOKED SO UNCOMFORTABLE, AND JUST DIRTY (WE PUT A BLANKET OVER IT TO EVEN JUST SIT DOWN). When I was at the front desk to try to get this straightened out i was told that there was nothing that they could do, and that no doubles were available. I asked to speak to the manager, and was told that he would be there the next day. Not surprisingly he never showed up - found out upon check out that he was away for the weekend. 

House keeping came to clean (& i use the word loosely) our room and took our towels, & DID NOT REPLACE THEM. when we called the front desk for new ones we were told that house keeping left for the day so we would most likely not receive towels for the night. the next morning we had to call THREE (3) TIMES (waiting over an hour)  BEFORE WE RECEIVED OUR TOWELS, we even offered to go pick them up. At this point we were running close to check out time and of course they would not give us an extension.

WE SAW DEAD FLYIES SMASHED ON THE WALLS.
AND THE NAPKIN HOLDER WAS SO DIRTY - but instead of cleaning it, it was covered with a ""display"".

tripadvisor,"Not worth the price - bad service, useless breakfast restaurant, facilities not working
We were 10 people in the party, 4 rooms:
1.
Checkin was delayed from 4 pm to 5:30 pm. The reception told us to go down to the beach and come back. Serious - after 12 hrs. travelling? We talked to serveral other guests at the hotel and 4 said the same. Their rooms wasn't ready, when they arrived.
2.
Wi-Fi wasn't working. Two of us in the party had to work during the stay and need the Wi-Fi as we're from Europe. It took their IT-dept. two days to fix it. It was a general problem at the hotel and not only our routers.
3.
It took up to 20 min. to get our cars from the inhouse valet parking, which by the way cost you USD 40 a night even though it's in the hotel.
4.
Breakfast is served at a restaurant in the same building. You have to go out the door and around a corner in order to eat your breakfast. Now comes the funny part: You have to wait in line outside as the restaturant is a small one serving other hotels too. What if it raines? I tell you as it did two mornings when we visited the hotel: You and your party waits outside  in a line until there are vacant tables - in the rain. Serious! A 4* hotel - this is hilarious!
Two in our party had to eat their bread from the table on morning, as no plates was given. WTF????

Pool and spa at top of the hotel. Yep....or....the spa wasn't working and according to a young couple who has been at the hotel earlier this year it didn't work then either. It wasn't something that happened ""yesterday"".

tripadvisor,"The room was gorgeous, but the hotel service ruined it. The people were nice, but clueless and hotel policies are terrible.

We paid 585(ish) per night for a room.  
Valet was $40 / night
Plus taxes and a $30 resort fee per night

When i booked the room, I asked for a King. I didn't get it. 
When I booked the room, I asked if the hotel had a bar, they said yes.

When we checked in at 3:30 they refused to let us into the room until 4pm. I've never actually had a hotel have this issue heading into a weekend.  

They said I owed roughly 1300 for the whole weekend (upfront) after taxes, etc. But i had already paid them 600+ for one night up front. They had no record. I literally had to send them a copy of my cc receipt. This was not off to a good start. 

so we went ot check out the pool. when we got there, there was no bartender or any sign that there was one there. When we went to ask...the front desk looked dumbfounded because they had no idea where he was. 

Next day we checked back and he was finally there. So we ordered a few drinks (which no joke took about 30 minutes). I ordered a 13 rose. It was flat and honestly tasted like Franzia. When my friend asked what type of tequila they had for the margarita the bartender said ""it's alcohol"" .  I'd expect this at a 100 a night hotel...not almost 600 a night.

The towels and toilet paper in the room are as cheap as cheap could be.

Now here's the kicker that through me over the edge with this place. I saw an added fee on my bill . When i called to ask what it was: 

THE IN-ROOM NESPRESSO PODS. I have never been to a hotel in my life that charges, and i'm including some really low end places. I was dumbfounded.

tripadvisor,"Just returned from five-days in South Beach.  Stayed Sun-Fri (am) at the Boulan using a package deal from a travel site (air hotel).  I was expecting a king room --we got a king room, with a gorgeous bathroom, living room and full kitchen.  A wonderful surprise and we were able to move in and be comfortable.

We found the staff pleasant and helpful.

The room was clean and maintained well.

The location was at 21st and Collins across from Collins Park.  We did not have a beach view from our room but looked south on Collins.  Sunday night was kind of loud (from outside of the hotel --some other location had a banging party apparently).  The beach is one block away from the hotel.  There are numerous hotels, hotel bars, and restaurants (upscale and regularly priced places) within easy walking distance.

Roof top pool was gorgeous in terms of view of Miami, part of the ocean, and up and down Collins.  We enjoyed the beds.  The music was great (lots of speakers, good vibe).  The pool water was WARM, but again enjoyed the vibe.

Hung out at the pool three days; generally earlier in the day --only saw the bartender once.

They do charge two bucks each for the espresso pods for the espresso maker --was supervised, but it was on the information sheet they give you at check in.

Fitness center was small, but a great range of cardio (treadmill, elliptical, and recumbent bike), plus free weights, a bench, as well as pulley/cable type weight systems.  The fitness center could use more regular cleaning, but it suited our needs.

We did use the beach and beach chairs and found the staff very helpful --Bianca and Jeremiah. 

All in all we were pleased with the Boulan.",8.0,SwimmerintheMitten,2017-03-31,,Couple,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I have to give it a 1 star as the entire sink in powder room detached from the wall as my 13 yr  old daughter was using it. Luckily she only got a bruise and it only grazed her foot. Could have smashed her foot.
I did not receive one phone call from management to apologize,  check on my daughter,  nothing.  I suppose this happens all the time!! 
Maintenance was quick to come and wanted to lock the door since it was a safety hazard.  I think a sinks coming off walk IS  a safety hazard!!

tripadvisor,"I stayed here for a 3 night weekend trip for my birthday from NY with my sister and daughter. The first issue was that the taxi driver from the airport could not find the hotel because the entrance is not on Collins even though the address is Collins Avenue. This was an annoying start. Check was easy enough. We booked the rooftop terrace. I was really nervous because some of the reviews said the room was dirty and stained. I was happy with the room layout, decor and rooftop access. I did see a few things that took away from the  ""luxury"" such as the outdoor furniture needed replacing. No cushions and badly damaged. The terrace was stained and needed painting. They need to attend to these issues. My two major issues were 1- my adult daughter left her key in the room and they refuse to give her another one stating she wasn't the credit card holder. This is ridiculous because her name was listed during booking and at check in. I had to come to the desk. 
The 2- Major issue was that this was a short trip and the pool/rooftop was closed for Sun & Mon. This was an absolute disappointment. They cited another guest broke glass and the pool needed draining. Ok safety however no attempt to give a credit/ waive a fee or offer an consolation except ""sorry""
The location of the hotel is great. The beach is across the street 1 block over. It is not a ""private"" beach at all, so not sure why they say that. 
Overall I would stay here again, we had a lot of fun. I had a late flight they declined my request to check out 1 hr later.  I love Miami

tripadvisor,"We arrived to a much awaited vacation. We rented a Penthouse suite to have 24 hour access to the rooftop pool and hot tub. The pool and hot tub were closed for 3 days of my 6 day stay. I am unable to go to the beach so I was shocked no arrangement was made to allow guests to use a neighboring hotels facility. The queen size sleeper sofa was dirty and only had a mattress that was double. Kids could not sleep on it so they brought in 2 folding beds which took up the free space in the room. The light in the bedroom did not work and maintenance said they needed to order a transformer-didn't happen while I was there. At night the rooms were very dark. TV remotes did not work and that was a 2 day fix.  The continental breakfast - We were told they were out of bread and rolls. No substitute was offered. When I asked why the penthouse next door had complete furniture and a bar on their balcony and we had only 2 chairs not lounges I was told that room had a different rate. A penthouse at any rate is intended to be luxurious- this was sub-standard to any regular room I have vacationed in. To end our trip the last night at 1:30am there was a fire evacuation. The staff did not seem organized or prepared. Very scary. So after taking up so much of the vacation time I paid for they said they could not extend a late check-out. What I will say is that the staff are Very friendly, they try to help but much of the problems were out of their control. The manager did apologize and make an adjustment, however money does not compensate a disappointing vacation.

tripadvisor,"I was am so happy to say that I took a chance booking the Boulan. I usually stay at places that are more ""KNOWN"" but when I saw the reviews and the photos, I decided I would give it a GO and now, I am happy to say this is my GO TO spot! The check in was fast and easy. I booked a great room with a terrace that was so spacious. I needed a bedroom with privacy since I was traveling with my teen and her friend. It was a great location. With Lyft we were able to get down to Lummus Park for $5 and took 5 minutes with a bit of traffic. The free breakfast was for ""2"" even if you book a room for 4, so be cautious of that. It was clear on the paperwork, I just missed that. The pool was amazing. There was so much seating and lounge chairs... Great SUN on the roof... I was thrilled with the music playing and the vibe! Beach was 2 minutes away, you are right across from Setai and I saw a few celebrities on the beach and in the front of the hotel. So, it is a very HOT SPOT out of the typical chaos of SOBE. Finally, the bathroom, clean, modern and so BIG! The closet space was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The kitchen was great to have even if I never planned of using it... AND the absolute ONLY issue I had was.... THE MATTRESS. Not sure if it was all the rooms or just mine, but... If I could change ONE thing it would be the mattress. It was a little less PLUSH than I like, but that might just be ME again!

tripadvisor,"A few friends and I went to Miami the beginning of April. After a long-haul flight we were excited to just arrive and relax at our much anticipated hotel. However, this was far from the case. Upon arrival there was no one to greet/welcome guests to the hotel at the front door. Secondly there was only ONE person at the front desk with  fustrated guests in front of us. We were finally seen and given the remaining balance of our room, as well had only paid a deposit prior. We were given the amount to pay which was over $1,000 more fban what we had booked for on booking.com. If we hadn't know we would of been robbed by this hotel. We let the lady at the front desk know that this wasn't incorrect and after some back and forth she said we were indeed correct that this was the wrong amount. She then went on to say that her system was down so she did not have the rate we had booked out hotel room on. We then had to bring out our booking confirmation and she then began presenting us with room rates from the air! We went back and forth for over an hour before she unapologetically said that she will have to pass this onto the reservations team to sort this out and said we should only pay for our room service fee. To add insult to injury she made us aware of taxes which were not included in our booking confirmation. Anyone thinking of staying at this hotel be aware that aside from then $34 resort fee per room, per night there is a 14% tax per night per room and $450 dollar incidentals fee, which gets held on your card per room per night and is released once you check out. However this can take up to 10 business days to be released to you depending on where you are from and your bank! 

After that embarrassing  ordeal at front desk we were finally given the keys to our room. We had two standard one bedroom suites. They were very spacious and modern. However, be aware that furniture has slight wear and tear, lights are not working, AC does  not work properly. Saying this  Matientence are very quick to respond to any issues you may have.

The hotels locafion is great - right on Collins Avenue, close to many restaurants, bars, south beach, ocean drive, Lincoln Road. You will always have something to do/somewhere to go whilst being at the hotel. 

Amenities such as the pool and direct access to the beach was not available  during our stay. So I will norm be able to comment on this. We wouldn't have even known if it wasn't for guests before us complaining that they wanted to leave. 

The breakfast is a waste of time do not bother including this in your boooking. The restaurant in which you have  breakfast is not in the hotel but a minute walk away. This is not the problem but more the lack of breakfast options. Be prepared to only have 6 options to chooose from. They also do not have the greatest service in the restaurant.  A great option for breakfasts would be Rosetta's Bakery a fee blocks away from the hotel. 

Housekeeping are not consistent, we had to mention to the front desk that our rooms had not been cleaned for two days. Also, do not expect much from the housekeeping. Mainly just a change of sheets and new towels. 

Last but not least, upon check out we were held up AGAIN! We had paid for our room halfway through our seven night stay after going back and forth with the reservations team. However the same lady who checked is in had the audacity to tell us tbere was a small fee remaining when we  had paid for everything. She then went into the office and kept us waiting for ober 30mins. We had a flight to catch back homeboy yet there was no urgency in anything they were doing. If we had missed it flights would they have paid for five flights back to the UK? NO. 

The lack of urgency, empathy, friendliness and general good customer service is nothing i have ever seen before. Customer service should be at the forefront of everything  business does. As at the end of the day we are what keeps your business running in the first place! As well as this, not knowing how much ones booking is, is so ridiculous. All of this should been prepared prior to us arriving at the hotel. If you are going to work with intermediaries such as booking.com you need to ensure you guys have communicated effectively so there is no confusion for guests. There are so many things to be taken from this and I really hope as a hotel you imorove on this, as the hotel has great potential.

tripadvisor,"The location of the Boulan is superb in the middle of South Beach a couple of hundred yards from the beach and close to the 5 star hotels, the Setai, the 1 and W hotels. 

The great strength of this hotel/condo complex is the size and quality of the apartments and value for money. Our 1 bedroom suite was very spacious around 900 sft with a high quality kitchen and bathroom and spacious living area with sofa bed. What you are getting is more than a hotel room or suite of a 4 star hotel. Try to ask for a room with a view of the park or side view of the Ocean. Ours looked on to the Setai and Collins a busy road - the double glazing was very effective against road noise - you can hear it very occasionally but no real issues here  

The reception staff are all very friendly and helpful and try hard to please. Compliments to the lovely Laura always ready with a smile and help. Usually requests for maintenance or service are met promptly and usually resolved quickly. 

Now for the minor niggles:

1 Breakfast at the restaurant Orange Blossom - off site is good quality but very limited basically a choice of a croissant/muffin, a small bowl of fruit or a pancake plus tea or a juice - it's the reason breakfast is included in the price. We had lunch and dinner here as well and the food was delicious. 20 percent off dinner bills only. The happy hour menu is good value at 10 USD a course. 

2 Internet is good and fast but sometimes tricky to log on to and you repeatedly have to log on after not using for any length of time - slightly annoying. 

3 Beach is fine - complimentary towels and loungers - USD 10 for an umbrella - not as swish or comfortable as some of the 5 star hotels. 

4 Roof top pool is a good amenity but cleaning and maintenance could be improved - the upholstered mattresses need a good clean and the pool area has a feeling of being slightly run down. Lots of space though and plenty of sun loungers. 

5 minor issues with apartment - the on/off buttons on the stove didn't work so the only way to turn off according to maintenance was to switch the fuses on and off! I agree with other reviewers that maintenance is reactive rather than pro-active. Also one side table didn't have a bed side light. The apartments are individually owned so are likely to have their own quirks. 

Overall, we have been very pleased with our stay and I believe Boulan offers very good value for money, up market Accomodation and a great location. If you are willing to accept the minor niggles and you aren't expecting a 5 star hotel for a 4 star price, then I highly recommend a visit; we would definitely consider returning.

Arrived around 7PM, a Saturday night. No valet at the door. We had to go in, to the front desk to inquire. We were told we would have to wait. Just leave our luggage and car on the street. Hmmmm. Neighborhood.....  hmmmmm.
Staff was very cordial and courteous throughout the stay.
The room was a nice spacious space. Modern. Comfortable. Ample closets, cabinets and drawers.
However, upon our arrival, we had to ask for towels, soap, shampoo, etc. We also had to ask for sheets, blankets, pillows and hairdryer. No Kleenex. In room safe box did not work. Dust balls and previous occupant's dirty clothes were not removed.  And told no plastic bag for dirty clothing was available, only if used for in house laundry service. Light bulb out, a pet peeve of ours. Our suite was on Collins. The noise level was extremely loud and constant.

tripadvisor,"My husband and I stayed here for my birthday for a weekend beginning Jan 21.  the PH suite was AMAZING! great space, great décor. Staff was also helpful and friendly. The only concern was the maintenance and housekeeping habits. Our furniture on our private deck was really in bad shape..it was wicker so it was basically falling apart. Also the floors in the PH were all marbled. So every stain showed. Who ever had our suite before we arrived had lots of fun(I can tell by the stains left on the floors in the bathroom, as well as the bedroom. Housekeeping hours were limited during the day so we were not able to call to complain right away. When we did, We told them to pay close attention to the floors ESPECIALLY the bathroom. Needless to say when we got back from shopping everything was spotless EXCEPT the floors those stains were still there. It was my birthday so I did want to spend the entire weekend harping on filthy floors. Also the Sauna was full of Sand and it didn't work. So basically there was just hot sandy water. There was no towel person to take the used towels from the pool so they were piled up all over the place. The dirty towel hamper by the pool area was filled beyond the rim and stacked up and falling over on the floor. When we were checking out the manager did say they were very short staffed(employees went to other hotels) so I am going to contribute the lack of cleanliness and maintenance to that reason. We come to Miami beach at least twice a year. We were considering staying at Boulan again but NOT under these conditions. I am a nurse and I work very hard for my $$. For the $$$ we spent per night I didn't appreciate nasty floors( putting it lightly) I don't want to go into details about what was on floors.  Maybe I will return, but I am not sure at this point.

tripadvisor,"Stayed here for 4 nights. First impressions UGH!!!!! The pictures do this place a lot more justice that it is actually is. Firstly, the valet is controlled by a public car park around the back of the hotel. it is $40 per night (probably the cheapest in Miami!) however I would rather have paid more for better service and trust in the people parking my car! 

Hotel entrance is shabby, and more on a back street. Through to the lobby, we were thinking oh no, what have we done booking here! Check in was poor, staff didn't know what they were doing. Lots of hidden charges. $30 per night service charge, and also around $600 deposit taken on swipe of card. This was not communicated that it would be taken and in fact blocked my credit card for the remainder of my stay! 

Public areas, pool and terraces are in dire need of care and attention. Looks shabby and not taken care of. The rooms are very much the same. As previously mentioned, the floors are marble (which look great!) however are stained, scratched and dirty. The furniture in the apartment has also seen much better days. A real shame as the room blew us away! Was not expecting to walk into something so special after the poor appearance of the outside and lobby. The housekeeping leaves much to be desired. It is almost non existent! Everywhere is dirty, and when asked for the room to be deep cleaned after check in, we were told the housekeeping had gone home. It was only 4pm! 

I left a review of check in on expedia and first thoughts of the hotel, Boulan replied to say the management would contact me. This did not happen. 

Just to add, it seems that Boulan and South Beach are two separate hotels.

Wouldn;t recommend staying here. For the price, I would next time stay at one of the more upmarket chain hotels along the beach front.

Mainly because they offer a nice modern luxurious apartment with huge square footage however , sense The last time I was in Mismi they have changed management which is not a good thing . Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised because usually I stay in the one bedroom suites that they offer but this time I booked a 2 bedroom and the layout was stunning . The bones on this place were very impressive which is why I'm rating it a 3 out of 5. Ungortunatly despite the beautiful rental the unit was not completely clean . The whole point of booking this type of space was because I was traveling with my family and the unit offered a full kitchen but guess what ?!? When I went to grab it unseals to eat the dishes put away were filthy . It was as if they had never been cleaned . I phoned the manager on duty who promised to send housekeeping up once they arrived . 45 minutes later they arrived all right speaking Spanish with a very frustrated tone as they were cleaning . When I pointed out that the bar hadn't even been cleaned off and that there was sand in the sofa the lady snapped at me stating that she knows ! After that I just decided to take care of the other minor missed items on the cleaning checklist myself which I shouldn't have had to do for over 700.00 a night! 

Our stay there however was rather relaxing the space was peaceful and the European guy at the rooftop pool made all my worries go away although the food we ordered was disgusting . But even still he had a great attitude and the energy was nice. 

BEWARE!!!! When it was time for departure I phoned the front desk asking for a taxi to be phoned to take us to the airport . Once we got downstairs there was a unmarked van with a driver stating that he would be taking us to the airport . It wasn't until I got into the van and didn't see a meter that I started to wonder if this was a unlicensed/ undocumented driver. The driver then proceeded to tell my husband the fee that he would be charging and that he accepted cash only . But by then we were already in route . ( by the way this was not a Uber or licensed cab driver ) ( this is an illegal practice in Miami !) I was actually made aware of this type of thing from our cab driver the night before stating that those types of people were ruining the cab business and that hotel workers charge make money / referral fees by using those drivers . My problem with this is it's extremely unsafe to put the guest of your hotel into some random van just to make a few extra bucks and it's illegal . I phoned the manager on more that one occasion to report the incident and follow up ultimately all I got was an apology I never received a follow up call once the video suvailance was supposedly reviewed . 

Over all I recommend NOT staying at this place . For this type of money the service and safety measures should be much better!",4.0,Luxuryopinion,2016-09-07,,Family,7.4,1201

The rooftop pool super cool. My nine-year-old daughter had lots of fun as well.  The free breakfast at the Orange Blossom is very limited, however, so it's best just to make your own breakfast in your room.

These used to be condos and some of the rooms still are which makes it weird. No real lobby, no restaurant, no breakfast room... Rooms are big but not really clean, there are pieces falling off the wall etc. The staff was nice but they couldnt really do anything as this place doesnt even look like a hotel, so the front desk was more like a doorman station...

We actually had two bedrooms with two bathrooms which made getting ready easier. The hotel is right across from the beach which was perfect. The location couldn't be better! We were away from all the craziness of south beach but a 5 min uber ride away when we wanted to party, dine, and shop. We enjoyed our stay there.

She thought I needed the trip.  Fortunately, the rooms were very large which made it easy to move around and relax, and the staff was incredible.  They helped me with whatever I needed.  They offer free warm breakfast inside the hotel, but for some reason, we could only access it by leaving the hotel and walking around to the front, which really wasn't a big deal because the weather was so nice.  I want to thank Jimmy, the General Manager specifically.  Even though the beach was across the street, it was still a bit of a walk for me.  Jimmy gave my sister his cell phone number and each day when she called, he had a staff member take his car, pick us up, and drive literally across the street to the hotel's private beach.

tripadvisor,"If you are reading this review it is possible because you are searching for different options of Hotels in Miami south beach, and Boulan brought your attention. in this review I would write my opinion of this hotel and my horrible experience with the attempt of warning next visitors.

In general 
 The hotel has nice areas, and a grateful design, but their care in cleaning is below zero. Both common areas and rooms lack of cleaning, and for the price you are paying it is absolutely impertinent. 

My room 
We were 5 persons in my group and they told us the suite would be perfect for us, since there are two rooms where two persons can sleep and a sofa cama.  the first night we arrived there, expecting the room will be organized, as it usually is in all hotels before night, the sofa cama wasn't organized, therefore we had to do it after a long trip from home. once we had arranged everything and we played in the bed, we were surprised on how uncountable it was, therefore we called the front desk for a possible solution, their answer was to sent an extra bed, we where happy for the solution but once it arrived it was worse than sleeping on the floor, therefore one of us had to sleep that night in that uncomfortable sofa cama, although we had payed for an amazing night... for the couple next couple of days we continuously asked at the front desk for a solution to this problem and the answer was that there wasn't more bed available.. ""Great! i've payed tons of money to get back cramps all my holidays!""
Additionally  although a lady entered every morning to clean the room and make our beds up, i believe the only thing she did was to make the beds, sincerely there was no cleaning at all!
the kitchen that was supposed to be full equipped, had no pans, cereal bowls, spoons, water boiler etc.. 

The attention 
The front desk is a clear disaster, many of them are really rude, and there is no response to what you ask for them. 
The bellman where GREAT!, amazing attitude and always collaborative :) 

this are some of the things that my family and i went through, without mentioning the loss of a bag with a really slow response from the hotel, and many other circumstances no one wants to experience in their vacations paying so much expecting the best, but actually receiving the worst.",6.0,Sofia S,2016-07-04,,Family,7.4,1201

All upscale amenities, nicely decorated, clean, and very stylish. Although we didn't use the pool it was available to us. The only draw back was I saw red ants in the kitchen area and the water took a while to heat up, so much so that we had to call maintenance to show us how to work the complicated nozzle. However, over all we loved it. The unit that we rented was nothing short of perfect. No complaints. We had such a good relaxing weekend I totally forgot to take pic of the unit.

tripadvisor,"Dear travelers,
The Boulan Hotel has relaxed 5 star feel, much more than other hotels. You get here definitely all you need. Me and my girlfriend had just a great stay. 
The location is great. This was the perfect distance to all the hustle and bustle of South Beach and gave you the luxury and enjoyment you needed way from the craziness. 
The frond desk manager Anthony amazed us as he was the first person we met in The Hotel. The check in went smoothly within couple minites. Anthony also provided us with all informatios about the Hotel and amenities that the Hotel has. 
The room (512) was actually huge suit with great Collins avenue view. It took my breath as I didn't expect so much luxury. 
If you like the beach, the hotel provides beach access which is located right across the street. You get there quick, however if you like pool, just take an elevator and roll it to the roof pool. Great view, nice pool, comfortable cabanas and good vibes.
Breakfast was delicious, the service was nice and on point. Our breakfast was on the table within 6 minutes what is unexpected if the restaurant is packed, therefore I am sure everyone has enough options ""ala carte"" to start day with.
With that being said, the Boulan Hotel deserves extra *stars*.
I will definitely be back soon.",10.0,Martin M,2016-07-21,,Group,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I booked this hotel 7 months in advance for our annual girls trip. We arrived for check in only to find out that the 2 BR condo was now unavailable to us due to 'maintenance issues, since 11am.' No one from the hotel bothered to call me to let me know this was the case until we arrived for check in at 4pm. This was very upsetting since the sole purpose was to have all 6 of us together. The girl checking me in acted like she couldn't care less. They instead offered to give us 2 separate rooms next to one another. We had no choice but to accept and stay anyway. Let me say that the rooms may have been sequential in order, but they were not next to each other.  Since we were celebrating a special occasion (and because she knew we were less than satisfied with the situation) the manager offered to send us up a special treat to help us get our celebration started. 3 hours later it was delivered to our room. Now, if I'm the management of a hotel and I know I've screwed over a customer, I'm going to bend over backwards to make things right. It didn't seem apparent that they had any interest in doing so. My room had a strange man bang on our door at 6am and wake us up. He stated he was from the front desk so my friend called down to the front desk to ask about it. The man who answered the phone acted like he was being put out with a dumb phone call meanwhile we are 3 girls in a room scared because we can't see who it is. There was NO PEEP HOLE IN THE DOOR. That's a safety issue! I immediately told the manager of this situation and again all I got back was lip service. She said she was going to have the building manager look over the security tape and let me know what they find. I have yet to hear anything from her. 
This hotel is in major need of sprucing up. There is peeling wallpaper, dents and dirt on the walls. The front desk area is dark and dreary. The hallways are very hot, not air conditioned. 
The restaurant for the continental breakfast is way around the corner from the hotel. It's not connected at all. Our experience eating there was so-so. My pancakes were good but a couple of my friends said the yogurt and fruit the had was warm and with no taste. Menu choices were also very slim. 
I will never stay at this hotel again!! Nor will any of my friends. This isn't the place to stay when you are in Miami!! There are much nicer hotels. Choose one of those instead.",2.0,twinmommy01,2016-07-23,,Group,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"Hotel is in a great location, easy walk to both South Beach and Lincoln. All of the hotel staff were great and very friendly.  Room was amazing, great size and very modern, full kitchen facilities, however it lacked in utensils and we only had 2 glasses (friends had to drink wine from cups which wasn't a big deal but worth a mention).   Unfortunately there were more bad things than good.  The pool area wasn't the best, Jacuzzi was cordoned off with no water in and a huge tiled water feature was out of order with no water in it.  The pool bed covers and cushions were filthy, covered with stains (not sure if they are ever cleaned).  On top of cost of the hotel (which isn't cheap)  there is a daily service charge which covers the cost of Wi-Fi - which is extremely temperamental (it only works 30% of the time), it covers sunbeds at the beach which were great (any umbrellas were extra though) and it covered breakfast in nearby restaurant Orange Blossom which was delicious, however the cost only covered a croissant, fruit or waffle  anything extra had to be paid for.  In Miami noise is to be expected however drilling and banging from nearby building site at 6am is not.  The noise through the night from nightclub underneath the hotel (but not part of the hotel) was ridiculous I understand its a party location but not everyone wants to party until 4am every day.

tripadvisor,"This hotel has some tricks. First of all: The address is wrong. You will be driving for hours if you try to find it in GPS. The correct address is 220 21st street. I arrived at night, could not find it for 45 minutes. Second: choose the room wisely. There are small rooms that are not so good and larger rooms. They are more expensive, but they will make your experience completely different. Third, the services are ok. You can get to the beach with towels, but the hut at the beach is the smallest of all and the guys work only in restrict hours. They can stay looking at you waiting for 5 minutes to get their working hours. The larger room is good and has many services. But the balcony is always dirty. I do not know why the housekeeping never clean the balcony. I know because there was something like a white foam in the floor and it never got cleaned. So it is not a case that they clean and they get dirty again. it is never cleaned, believe me, The room and the appliances are ok, but sometimes, you have NO ice in the refrigerator. And always the valet... the valet has its own time, mainly if you are driving to the airport to get a plane. It took me 30 minutes waiting for my car, that was always ""The next one arriving shortly"". I was luck not to lose my flight. but not thanks to the efficiency of their valet park. So, be warned about this. The bed though is very good and comfortable. Wifi is not. It looks like they have a DNS problem. From time to time, you get dropped and it starts again. If this is not a problem for you, you will survive (causal wifi user), if you are working, be aware. Get the rooms in the corners (numbers ending in 2 or 3) to get the better view of the beach. One block away (not beach front) and beach view because of a square that makes a block without building and you can see the beach, so , the higher the room, the better.",6.0,Alexandre P,2016-09-02,,Couple,7.4,1201

The bad: it can be noisy if you are on the lower floors. Parking is $40 per day and it takes a while to get the car. The breakfast... Nothing special, would skip it and eat somewhere else for what you get.
The ugly: paid extra for ""ocean view"" but I could not see any but a sliver on the horizon and we were on the side of Collins, which made the room noisy.

But what lifts this place above all the others is the staff; you're always greeted with a beaming smile and a hearty ""Good morning."" Nothing is too much trouble, they rush to help you with bags / baby strollers / doors. 

From the moment we arrived we were greeted so nicely, the checkin was made super fast because they anticipated we'd be tired from our flight, the room was ready so we could go straight to sleep. So thoughtful. It continued like that for our whole stay.

The rooftop pool is a good size, and has a nice variety of shaded and unshaded loungers. The bar and restaurant on the roof have a good selection of food and drinks and fast service.

Breakfast is in a restaurant in the same building, but you need to walk along the street (about 50 yards) to get there. That's really no problem, and the staff there are just as nice and friendly. The place has a real friendly atmosphere throughout.

The rooms are phenomenal: we had a 1100 sq foot apartment, luxury fittings throughout including super comfortable bed with silk soft bed sheets. Great kitchen, bathroom, and even a washer and dryer - we're going home with all clean clothes (even more relaxing - no laundry when we get home).

Where do I start.. The spa in the pool area was filthy and soo bad that not 1 guest got in ! Half of the pool deck was ripped up and there was noisy drills and banging right next to pool where we were trying to relax for most of the day.  There were  several day beds around the pool.

The view from the roof top pool was a building site from all corners. No pool bar or staff around the pool. 
The hotel offers free wifi but but only worked in a few locations around the hotel and not very well. To buy a bottle of water we either had to walk about 10 mins to the nearest shop or pay for room service.

We had a late check out and there was no facilities to shower so we ended up showering by the pool and getting changed in the toilets. Not what we expected after paying a lot of money to stay there. 
We walked around the area and lots of better hotels with lower star ratings available and at a much lower cost! Very disappointing hotel.",2.0,theowl12,2016-05-27,,,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"So first we arrived way too early in miami, June 5th at 6a.m so I decided to call our hotel which we have reservation with for 3 days and ask if they can do an early check in and we'll just pay the extra charge, I was super surprised when I called the front desk and a man pick up the phone  and just said ""HELLO?"" I WAS PUZZLED maybe I called the wrong number? So I ask him if I called boulan south beach? And he replied plainly with ""YES"". I think it was rude and very unpleasant. To make the story short me and my friends ended up going to the hotel early like at 8am and the front desk personal was there and her name is Blanca she's polite and she explained to us that she's gonna try to get us our hotel room as early as possible, we literally still waiting for our hotel room as we speak for more than 6 hrs, it's still not 4pm which is the indicated time for checking in but 2 groups of people just check in after us and was able to get their room quickly, we kept on checking on her if there's any room available but she said there's none ready, we know it's not her fault but what explanation does she have about those 2 group of people who was able to get their room already.

tripadvisor,"Great location, huge rooms, modern facilities - all sounds great but unfortunately, it ends there...We stayed there with our kids because the room was huge and had a pull out bed in the (separate) living area. It also had a kitchen which is nice when traveling with the kids. That said, there was not a pot or pan to be found - no silverware and only two glasses. They provide a continental breakfast (pastries, couple of apples  and yogurts) and there is an excellent coffee maker in the room- but there is no room service. There is no service in the lovely garden and no service at the pool on the room, despite they have full set up for a bar and dining area. Its a bit odd. If you want a drink or eat at the pool, you have to have it delivered by a local restaurant. The pool was freezing and it took  literally six calls and two visits to the lobby to get towels for the beach area. It seems that there are two hotels in the hotel and the staff at the other was way more responsive. That said, we got a great price, the room and bathroom were huge and everything was very clean. It wasn't bad by any means - just really felt like there was no one in charge making sure all was run well.At the price, it was great - but I would not pay more a penny more and would think twice before staying there again (and bring a pan in my luggage!)",6.0,NYCNOA,2016-06-15,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"This place is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! Anyone who has left a negative review for this place is INSANE! We were in town for my cousin's wedding this past weekend. We chose the Boulan because it looked great online. But believe me when I tell you, that the pictures do this place no justice! Upon entering this wonderful place you are welcomed by a friendly attentive staff and the intoxicating fragrance of lemongrass and waterlily. This is a welcome reprieve from the scorching Miami heat. 

We make our way up to our room and open the door and BOOM! My head exploded and my mind was totally blown by how clean and stunningly gorgeous it was! Our suite had two water closets in addition to an enormous en suite with a deep soaking tub and a separate rainforest style shower. There was a very spacious living room/kitchen area that was sleek, stylish and functional. There was a sub-zero fridge with two freezers, a four burner cooktop, microwave, and medium sized convection oven.

 The bed was plush and clean, and so comfortable it was impossible to stay awake in it. The living room sofa was so comfortable that we all fell asleep on it after a night of partying. Just outside of our suite was a 30 foot balcony that could be accessed from either the living room or the bedroom with a view of Collins Avenue and the surrounding boutique hotels. 

On our last night together, my cousin the groom, who is classically trained chef decided to prepare an in suite meal for us. The room had most of what we needed as far as pots and utensils. Anything that wasn't available that we requested (i.e. additional pots and pans) was delivered to our room promptly. We entertained 15+ people comfortably for dinner that evening and had a BLAST! 

We were so busy having an awesome vacation that we didn't get to the Boulan's rooftop pool until our last day. It was PHENOMONAL! We had incredible city views and the pool and surrounding area was very clean and inviting. On our last day, we were running late checking out. Once again, the staff went above and beyond to meet our needs by giving us TWO complimentary hours to check out! THEN, they gave us beach passes, pool access, towels, and stored our luggage for us for several many hours until our flight left that evening, all AFTER we already checked out! 

Although it wasn't beachfront exactly; it was a 3 minute walk to the beach if that. This place is centrally located, and has a great parking lot across the street that is awesome, at $2/hr. Which is great because parking in the South Beach area is nearly impossible. The staff is exceptional and great at what they do. There was nothing that we asked for that they hesitated to accommodate us with. Alex, Oscar, and Blanca you guys are truly amazing and I miss you all already! I can't wait to come back and see your friendly faces again! You and the rest of the staff created a truly memorable experience for me and my family, and I simply cannot thank you enough!

I don't plan on cooking while on vacation so that does me no good. There is no pool attendant, no beach attendant-no one to serve you anything. They did say that we could use a phone at the pool and call to the desk to be patched into the restaurant downstairs and place an order. Oh great! So I will wait 30 minutes for a drink or food and then get up to a shared phone and have you patch me into the restaurant for more drinks-NO! That is not my idea of a $400+ night hotel.

tripadvisor,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights and enjoyed every minute.  We decided to rent a suite as we were bringing our dog (and the Boulan is pet friendly).  As they had availability, we were upgraded to the next level of suite, which absolutely made our stay perfection.  The suite was clean, modern, comfortable and roomy. It looked exactly like it did in the pictures.   Besides having a rooftop pool, hotel reserved loungers on the beach and an affiliated restaurant, what really made our stay was the staff.  Blanca, Oscar and Javier couldn't have been more friendly, welcoming or hospitable.  
We thought the hotel was in a perfect location as it was one block from the beach, in a slightly quieter stretch of Collins Avenue but very close to the bustling Lincoln Road.  It's also next door to the amazing One Hotel Rooftop Bar and delicious BeachCraft and The Continental.  We highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for comfortable, clean, modern, well-serviced, centrally located and self-catered residences.",10.0,h0b0ken07030,2016-03-06,,Couple,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"The location is excellent - a few minutes walk from Lincoln Ave, but on a quiet street opposite Collins Park. The space is awesome - huge kitchen / living room, 1.5 bathrooms, large bedroom, laid out beautifully with excellent functionality including huge sofa bed, sliding doors to bedroom for privacy, full kitchen including dishwasher, washer-dryer, full huge luxury bath and separate rain shower, just awesome space that we couldn't find anywhere else. For a family of 4 it was a luxury to have such a brilliant condo style room so close to Lincoln and the beach. Unfortunately, it really is a condo with a few additional facilities but you wouldn't really consider it a full service hotel. The lobby is functional with a very helpful team, the pool area is nice, and the beach is close by with a private section for the hotel with lounge chairs although you do have to pay for umbrellas which seems rather unnecessary considering the service/resort fee which doesn't actually seem to cover any hotel style amenities. There is no bar or on site restaurant - there is a place round the corner - Orange Blossoms - which the hotel uses for breakfast, bar service and room service. Beware - the hotel claims to include breakfast but it is only actually for 2 people so we ended up paying $30 a day for all 4 of us to have modest breakfast. Also the restaurant serves several hotels and is also open to the public, so there can be a lengthy wait which is really not ideal and is not what you would expect. Some mornings we gave up the wait, we thought that was really poor. Finally the cleaning service is patchy - some days excellent cleaning, others we had to ask several times for the right number of towels, they left the room mostly untouched, just a cursory wipe of the table and not much else. This hotel is not cheap by any means, and again, it isn't really a hotel in the traditional sense so we did begrudge paying additional service fees for no additional services. This really bumps up the price over a week and is quite misleading. However, for a longer stay it really was perfect, the room was comfortable and spacious, with lovely clean and sleek décor, and having moved from another hotel close by, we were delighted with the choice and wouldn't hesitate to choose to stay there again and recommend it to anyone wanting a hotel in the area.",8.0,lobbo1,2016-03-08,,Family,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"I keep a good memory of my stay at Villa Bagatelle. In a nutshell, the positive elements are:
- Comfortable beds (really!) and nice rooms
- Very good location, nearby the beach
- The overall cleanliness of the site
- Beautiful rooftop with a lot of opportunities

The bad comments are:
- Although the hotel is beautiful it looks like left abandoned (the rooftop pool wasn't cleaned during our stay: mattress on the floor, dirty towels left by visitors still abandoned under chairs, walls dirty, etc.)
- Missing elements in our room (we had to ask at least 3 times before getting it)
- We were in the middle of a change in the managing team. So we faced major troubles. The former management did block a deposit of 2000$ on our credit card when we checked in and we didn't know that. Therefore we couldn't pay our stay at the checkout. The frontdesk assured us that they didn't take  or block anything, which was obvisouly wrong. We spent minutes trying to explain that it did work at our arrival. And THEY are mistaken somewhere. At the end we had to find an alternative payment solution and we couldn't buy anything else due to this blocking. Back in our country, we checked with the bank and they confirmed that Villa Bagatelle had blocked this amount. We sent several emails to the hotel without ANY answer from their side.

Central to shopping on Lincoln and a short walk to the excitement on Ocean.  It was a little hard to find as the entrance is on a side street and no large signage.  We got there a few hours before check in so we had to wait for our room BUT the front desk agent was so friendly and pleasant we didn't care.  She called to let us know when our rooms were ready. One of our suites was upgraded to a larger suite and it was amazing.  Both suites had a fully equipped kitchen with oven, stovetop and fridge. We had two teens with us that slept on the sofa bed which was more than enough room for both of them. The bedroom had doors that gave us privacy.  There is only one full bathroom but the teens did have a half bath so that was ok.  I am big on cleanliness and I was not disappointment.  The only issue I had was a very rude valet driver but other than that it was perfect. the only other thing that could make it better would be if they had an on site bar and restaurant.

-make sure you know exactly what type of room you are getting. The room types differ radically from each other. 
-be sure you get a 'stylish' room. Those that are not in this category are not great. 
-the restaurant around the corner, Orange Blossom, provides room & pool service as well as breakfast. Only a continental breakfast for two people per room is included.  The reality is that this is a loose affiliation: you can't charge room or pool service to your room and delivery takes forever - 20 minutes for a drink at the pool.  
-the outdoor common space is quaint and the rooftop pool s a nice place to relax.

Of the best I've ever been experienced :)
Incredibly talented people all together.
The room was large and very nice, and was well cleaned.
The bed in the bedroom was super.
It was included loungers on the beach, which was very close :)
The grocery store is close, so it was easy to eat breakfast in the room.

It could be improved is:
- Not possible for 2 people to sleep on the couch
  - Expensive to hire an extra bed
- Breakfast for 2, when we ordered for 4 (this has already been converted)
- It says that the room is for 4 people, but there is a maximum of 3 adults and you have to have an extra bed for the 1 adults

There was a cot waiting in the room, there is plenty of storage, large areas to crawl around, a bath, washing machine and dryer, a space to park the stroller.

I've stayed at the Villa Bagatelle Miami property almost every year since 2011 and this last visit was by far, my most memorable + enjoyable stay. Many thanks to the front desk staff, Junie, Lauren and Oscar, who happily accommodated my early check-in request and blessed me with the most amazing room, PH9 ... a corner room with wraparound windows, providing clear direct views of the Ocean and Collins Avenue. I've always loved that the suites are extremely spacious and fully equipped like a condo, complete with in-room washer/dryer, full kitchen, living room, bedroom and 1.5 baths (including a very large full bathroom with soaking tub, rain shower and enclosed toilet room). The rooms are beautifully designed and quiet, with modern and comfortable furniture, full length mirrors for outfit checks, sheer white curtains that allow the right amount of sunlight through, cool to the touch floors, very strong and easy to control AC, and chic white/light colored interiors. There is more than enough closet space and drawer storage, with two TVs in the bedroom and the living room. I especially love the new addition of the daily complimentary breakfast delivery by the Breakfast Butler. I find the the location to be highly convenient ... right across the street from the Setai, the W, and the beach; a 5 min walk to Walgreen's and Lincoln Rd shopping is a brisk 15 min walk away. Uber also makes everywhere else in Miami highly accessible and affordable. The lobby and outside sitting area are always very inviting, especially when waiting for check-in or check-out. The options of the rooftop pool and fitness center are also greatly appreciated. There really is no other place that I feel more at home in Miami.

At around 11:30 pm I went down to the lobby to complain about the music from the restaurant below.  They promised this would stop at midnight, which was fine with us. However, when this did not happen, I called a couple of times after midnight to the front desk, who said they were sorry but could do nothing(?). The music did not stop until after 3.00 am. In the morning we complained and got upgraded to a standard suite, a very nice room (410).

Thursday morning I realised that I had forgotten our passports and some money in the safe in the old room, and reported this to the front desk. They went to fetch these, however, the money (about 500 dollars) was missing. They promised to investigate while we spent the day on the beach. When we got back, I met the security responsible, who pretty much suggested that had entered our old room myself and stolen the money myself. To support this they showed me a log of entries to the room, and somebody had swiped one of the old key cards at 1:30 am the night after we changed rooms. According to him, no other person had entered the room after our move. I asked them about the video logs (there are video cameras in the hall ways) in order to verify that I was not the one to enter the room, and they he said they would investigate this. I had, after all, handed back both key cards.

The next morning, when I talked to them, they were still investigating. I decided to contact the police and in short an officer arrived at the hotel. I reported the theft and the officer then interviewed to the security responsible and the front office manager. Some new things came to light:

1. Two other entries had been made into the room between when we left it and when the entry was made during the night. Both by hotel staff. Contrary to what they had stated earlier. 
2. The old card should have been deactivated when we moved to our new room. However, this never happened. the hotel could not explain why.

So, three entries, two by staff and one by somebody who used a card that was handed over to the staff of the hotel.

One would expect that management of the hotel would at least excuse themselves for what has happened, but nothing like that as of yet. When we left Miami at Monday the 28 the front desk manager stated that they were still investigating, interviewing staff etc. and that she would get in touch with us asap. This has still not happened and almost a week has passed since then. 

So, if you, after reading this, still decide to stay at the Villa Bagatelle, please be sure to lock your valuables away… As the other reviewers have stated, the location is great, the rooms are big, the beds are super, but if you cannot trust that your belongings will be safe, all that is not worth as much, in my opinion.",4.0,Martin J,2016-01-02,,Couple,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,Stayed at the Boulan for a week on new years and the staff was cold except for the doorman with a big smile on his face. There were no amenities and for that price there are so many better options. Unless you are a businessman looking for some time alone with no human interaction this is not the place for you. But the bathrooms were beautiful. The room decor was a little out dated -very 2004 chick.,6.0,Melis_Memi,2016-01-04,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"The room itself was perfect.  Elegantly decorated with full marble in the baths, fabulously textured wallpaper throughout, washer, dryer, full Italian-style kitchen, and I could go on.  For a family of three we loved the suite.   A light breakfast delivered in the morning was perfect since we do not eat a large breakfast.  So many amenities that I could move into this hotel.   The pool on the roof was perfect and the jacuzzi was what we needed after a day of walking.  But the downside.  Our room was on the Collins Street side.  If you are a light sleeper you will not be able to sleep comfortably.  A LOT of honking horns in this town.  Also our Direct TV did not work.  We spent two nights in the local bars watching sports which AFTER dinner cost us an additional $75 each night.  Maintenance didn't know how to fix the problem.  So we just went with the flow without letting it ruin our stay.   Overall this is a lovely hotel and I really liked it.  Also previous reviews said the staff was rude.  I only found pleasant and courteous staff.  The Asian man that checked us in was very sweet and friendly (sorry I didn't get his name).  As you can see from my reviews I have travelled the world and this suite was more like a finely decorated apartment.  I took pictures just in case I decide to buy an apartment somewhere in the world I'll use the pics as design inspiration.",8.0,traveltheworldcs,2016-01-13,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"Family of 3 (2 adults & 17yr old) staying 6 nights

Well located on Collins next to Collins Park so reasonably quiet and peacful. 
Valet and reception staff friendly and helpful. 
Property is clean and modern. 

Not a hotel. It appears to be a number of investment apartments that are managed on behalf of the individual owners. Whilst this in itself is not an issue it does mean that each apartment is differently decorated and furnished to slightly different standards. Also the apartments are in a different state of repair so if you are not happy with your allotted apartment ask to see another. 

Ok so the bad first. 
1st apartment... The Sofa bed mattress for our 17yr old son was approx 3 inches thin and all of the mattress springs were more than just visible. Desperately uncomfortable. The hotel manager arranged for a single bed to be provided and graciously agreed to waive the usual $50 a night charge for this. Unfortunately this wasn't exactly what we had envisaged when booking a clean modern apartment as the bed was permanently in the way. Only one of 2 bed side drawer units worked and there was no other clothes storage apart from a chest in the bathroom - Weird and insufficient. 
The apartment had also been redecorated in Grey and Aubergine so felt small and dark. This was exasperated by a missing ceiling light and felt very uncomfortable with the extra bed in the lounge.
We complained and were moved the following day when they had space.. Also given a bottle of wine. .. Nice touch.

2nd Apartment Must have been 50% larger modern clean and white. Just like the brochure. (Might be the actual apartment in the brochure) Much better but similar problem with the sofa bed. 
Master Double bed had slats under the mattress missing so ended up sleeping in a hole until it was fixed. Safe stopped working. Shower Extractor fan full of midges. Black out blinds on some windows but not others making the ones there fairly useless as light streams in the other large Windows. 
When problems were reported they were promptly rectified but it would appear that this hotel operates a fix on complaint procedure rather than regular ongoing maintenance. All in all getting tired with low grade furnishing. 

Booking included breakfast but were were told on arrival it was only for 2 people. It is provided next door in the Orange Blosdom restaurant and quite frankly was a bit of a joke. All carbohydrates and fruits. Pancakes, waffles, breads, fruit salad. Coffee OR. Juice. That's it. Shame really because the restaurant prepared a wicked Eggs Benedict if you are prepared to pay for normal menu. 

Ok the Good 
Clean modern chic apartments with comprehensive kitchens and marble bathrooms. Separate shower and Bath. 2 sinks. All good as per the brochure. 
Great rooftop pool although it is above the car park and so can be quite smelly with car fumes if wind blowing in wrong direction 
Great location next to Collins Park. 
Reception staff and valets very friendly and helpful. 
Good wifi.
Own section on beach with 2 complimentary sun loungers.

So would I stay here again. Maybe. If our son came and we needed the bigger apartment quite possibly but if it were only 2 of us definitely not. For the same price 2 people can stay in many of the great south beach hotels which all have better amenities.",6.0,Simon F,2016-01-13,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"Perfect experience for us!  I used to live in Miami Beach but had never been to Boulan.  We stayed in room 504 from January 8 - 10.  We arrived at 11:30 and check in wasn't until 4pm.  The doormen were wonderful, courteous and very quick with their service.  The front desk staff were just incredible.  They always had a sincere interest in how we were and how we enjoyed their beautiful hotel.  They were happy to check us in and then give us a space to change and check our luggage while we waited for our room.  We went up to the rooftop pool and were in love! It was cloudy so no one was there but us and we had a ton of cabanas and chairs and areas to ourselves.  Their is a very pretty walk in pool with a great view of South Beach and also a nice private hot tub.  We relaxed in both the social, grass filled area and the cabanas while we waited.  Then we went downstairs, grabbed our bags, changed again and headed to lunch at Lincoln Road Mall.  When we got back our room was ready.  The valet loaded up our luggage, we were give a real key (such a nice change these days) and went up to our room.

Now I booked an ocean view king suite but we must have been upgraded.  When we opened the door we both smiled ear to ear!  We had a two bedroom suite with the most amazing wrap around balcony!  Such a tremendous room and so well appointed!  It had a washer/dryer, two and a half baths, an enormous soaking tub, two incredibly comfortable beds, a beautiful living room, a walk in closet, four robes and a spectacular kitchen!  The art on the walls was so great and we just felt at home and wrapped in luxury at the same time.  I called to the desk immediately and told them how our expectations had been exceeded.  Really, we could have stayed in the room all weekend and would have been thrilled!

The private beach is directly across the street and the loungers are really nice.  We paid $10 cash for an umbrella because my bf likes shade and it was also very nice quality.  We were right next to the water and I posted the picture.  The beach there is gorgeous! You stop at the front desk and they happily give you as many towels as you need and vouchers for your chairs.  Very easy!

You really must take a look at the artwork in the hotel!  It was so wonderful and we had a great time checking it all out!  Housekeeping was thorough and our room was always made up by 11:00 when we came back from breakfast.

I have to take a moment to mention breakfast at The Orange Blossom.  I'm not sure if other reviewers are just patrons of typical 'Denny's' types of places or what but I cannot fathom how a normal sized person could not be happy with the complimentary breakfast offerings there!  My boyfriend is a large 6'1"" man and we both got the coffee and pancakes every morning (complimentary and delicious and pancakes are served with fresh fruit and syrup) and just simply added a side of bacon (for $3.50 - if buying this is breaking your budget I don't think this is the hotel for you) and were totally satisfied!  You don't come to South Beach to eat greasy lumberjack breakfast specials people! :)  The service there warranted our 30% tip - 18% is automatically added (too many folks from countries that don't understand tipping) and our server always obliged our request for the BOTTOMLESS mimosas for only $20! Best way to start your day in paradise!

Hands down this is my favorite place to stay in Miami Beach and we will be back soon!  The front desk was exceptional and had no problem printing out my plane tickets and the doorman got us a taxi right away.  If you stay and really want to live like a queen/king get room 504!  It was so wonderful and really worth it! I'm posting all the pictures of our room here :)",10.0,LuckiestPrincess,2016-01-17,,Couple,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"Stayed here for a couple of nights in their two bed deluxe, extremely spacious, clean, modern, so getting to grips with a few of the mod cons was awkward.  Roof top pool was a good size but getting to it was peculiar as you had to use a couple of lifts to get there.  We booked through bookings.com and in the write up stated that it had a bar, which it did not, also we were meant to have had a sea view, but unless you have a neck like a giraffe you would not be able to see past the building in front, so no it is not beach front, also you had to walk some distance to use their beds on the beach, which again, we were made to believe we did not have to pay for, but as we were a party of four, we only receive two complimentary beds and had to pay for a parasol etc. It is in a good location for eating out in the evenings.

They give you a continental breakfast in the morning. Ok, not bad right? Its, a Yoplait, a plastic spoon and piece of toast. They could really improve that. Easily...

The rooms are outstanding. We had a suite for 250 bucks a night. One of the best rooms under 1000 i have ever stayed in. And we paid 250. Nice location. They conveniently made a deal with another beach hotel so you can have a chair beach side. We will come back.

tripadvisor,"I visited Boulan apartments last December during Art Basel Festival. I love it as it is the best alternative to the over-priced South Beach hotels with the tiny box rooms. Boulan provides proper apartments for the same price, with fully equipped kitchen, living room, big balconies/terraces and separate bedroom with ensuite. It has everything you need. The pool on the roof top is fantastic if you want to chill out, but mind you it is always very quiet so do not choose Boulan if you are looking for a party, ""sceney"" pool area with a vibe. However, we prefer to stay here and visit the party hotels' pool areas as and when we wish since all the big hotels are very close. 
The location of Boulan, couldnt be any better. Just at the best part of South Beach. Next to W hotel, Wall club, SLS, Mr Chow... the list is long. Also there are a lot of cool fashion stores for shopping around the corner.
What was really cool about it is that during Art Basel they had some great artists from london making a massive mural on the roof top.
Another good point is that there is constantly security around the hotel hallways so we always felt safe.

The only downside is the breakfast which is served in a restaurant next door but taste, quality and variety are very poor. Hope they could improve that.",10.0,NatassaMarkopoulou,2015-09-11,,Group,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"Myself and two friends have just recently stayed at the bagatelle and stayed in a studio double. On check in we were greeted by Roger who informed us we would have to pay for extra breakfast for the third person despite the fact we had paid an additional charge for 3 people for the ten night stay and therefore we should have been treated as a party of 3, not 2. I was told by hotels.com we could have breakfast for 3 as after all we were paying an extra £55 a person per night. Roger said he would see what he could do and therefore breakfast was bought up to our room each morning which we therefore presumed would be for 3 with no extra cost as no one informed us of this, on check out we were charged ten extra breakfasts to which the friendly receptionist took the charges of due to mis communication. We also only received two robes and two towels until we asked for 3 from housekeeping each day. When you are paying for a ten night stay as 3 guests that's how you should be treated and not as a party of two. The air conditioning barely worked throughout our stay and the pool was also out of order for two days, therefore the service charge was taken off for this, along with the local room call charges which are advertised as complimentary, yet it was still on our bill at check out. 
The staff make the hotel, Kendrick, Novelle, Stanley, Anthony and Sam are all very friendly. It is nice to see such friendly faces when passing through the lobby and being greeted each time we came into the hotel. 
I think it would be good to have an option of hot cooked breakfast as fruit, croissants, yoghurt and bread can become tedious expensively on a lengthy stay. As there is no bar or restaurant specifically in the hotel so I suppose that is the reason for continental breakfast only. 
It would also be nice to have a bar on the rooftop terrace by the pool and would also increase hotel revenue as we were walking to the shop each day for drinks and snacks to consume around the pool. 
The rooms are really clean and modern and the hotel has a nice authentic vibe which all three of us noticed. The beds are also amazing along with the shower. 
All in all a great stay and made even better by the staff such as Kendrick, Novelle, Stanley and Anthony etc who always greeted us with a friendly face and willingness to help us with any issues we had.
Another note would be to have more management presence around the hotel, I have previously worked for Millennium and Copthorne hotels and we always had managers speaking to the guests etc and checking all operations are in working order, in this case the pool and the AC.

I would recommend the bagatelle based on the above positive points as the issues we encountered can be worked on and the location is also fantastic!",6.0,Christina L,2015-09-25,,Group,7.4,1201

We were VERY pleasantly surprised when we walked into our apartment/room.  It was superb!!!  Loved everything about it except one thing - the sofa bed.  We were 4 people - so 2 slept in the bedroom and 2 were to sleep on the sofa bed.  Well, we pulled it open and it was really bad - once you laid down on it, you could feel every spring coming through.  Not comfortable at all!!  :-(  So we ended up just sleeping on the sofa itself.  It was fine.  Overall, a very pleasant stay!!  The staff were so very friendly and went out of their way to help with whatever was needed. Thank you very much for a great stay!!

I came on a workation and it felt like a vacation!!!
Not only is this hotel one of the poshest on the beach but they treat you like family!
The service was impeccable, the room was huge and there were friendly faces everywhere :).
I do not usually write reviews, in fact the last time I wrote a review was back in the early 2000's for Le Sport (the body holiday) in St. Lucia. I was so impressed with this hotel that I felt I had to say something about it. It's a sparkling gem right there on Collins Avenue. 

Full disclosure: I arrived at the hotel stressed and had to complete some business for work, So I wasn't the happiest of campers. The staff did not know this so they assigned a room across from the maids station. When I saw this I immediately came down and asked for another room, because I read on trip advisor not to get a room by the maids station because of the noise. Even though they were almost at capacity, the manager, Laura immediately assigned me another room. When I asked about parking she informed me of all of the options and even though I thought $35 per night was expensive it was the most convenient as the street metered parking max was 3 hrs. @ $6.25 per. I then discovered I had forgotten my usb. adapter, which the hotel provided gratis. As the night progressed I realize that this room would not do because of the outside noise, which truthfully wasn't that loud but I still felt disturbed by it. I went downstairs the next morning, talked to Laura, who still attempted to accommodate me even at capacity; completely full. As soon as a room opened up (at noon) she moved me again.  The rooms are spacious, beautiful...The Kitchen area is uber modern with  microwave, sink, utensils, Fridge,  illy/nesspresso machine (delish coffee)... The beds in both rooms were super comfortable, 2 flat screen tv's : 1 in the bedroom, 1 in the kitchen/seating  area... The bathroom was ultra modern: beautiful shower and in the second room (errrr third room) had a beautiful soaking tub... absolutely what I needed when I needed. Everything was super clean and fresh. A free continental breakfast was provided every morning with assorted crossiants (sp?) tarts and bread with real butter, fruit spread yogurt and fruit. The free wifi is strong and dependable.
When I completed what I came to do I decided to take a break and go to the beach. Although this is not a beachfront hotel the beach is right across the street and they have contracted with The Raleigh to lease their chairs. So I  picked up my beach towels at the desk and headed to the beach where they set up my chair for me after I told them my name and room number. 
The hotel's fitness center has all of the latest modern cardio machines, free weights, a restroom and water fountains. It is smallish but not cramped and has two each of programmable ellipticals , recumbent bikes, treadmills, and cable machines as well as your standard squat, dead lift and benches.
The rooftop pool and hot tub is clean beautiful it also has a separate seating and bbq area...Oh! I almost forgot they also have a beautiful secluded garden with a water feature and nice landscaping where you and yours (in this case just me) can chill after a night out. 
With all of this of this beauty and convenience, I still think the best part of my stay was the service. From the maids to the manager every one was warm, pleasant and always greeted me with a smile even though I was kind of a pain in the butt. 
The valet had my car in minutes when I checked out. The front desk offered to hold my luggage if I wanted to further use the hotels amenities or explore south beach, the concierge offered me an umbrella as it looked like rain when I ventured out the second day. 
The only con is they do not have room service but there's a wonderful restaurant attached to the hotel and you can always walk up the street for tasteful restaurants of all kinds along Collins Ave.

tripadvisor,"Let me first start off by saying I'm very particular when it comes to booking hotels. I love chic hotels with separate living spaces, and I'm very anal about the cleanliness of hotels.
We arrived at 2pm - the room wasn't ready, so we explored Miami Beach for a bit. We arrived back at the hotel between 4-5pm to check in. I knew as soon as I got off of the elevator that the room wouldn't be up to par - the hallway wasn't fresh, the carpet hadn't been vacuumed either. 
We get to the room and the size was perfect. The decor however, was not what I expected from the pictures I saw online, but that wasn't the deal breaker. The room wasn't very clean. The floors were smudge and you could see some staining (as if someone dropped some spaghetti sauce). The half  bathroom was dirty (the toilet floor bolt looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the hotel opened), the shower head in the main bath had built up residue, vents were dusty. The floor boards throughout were scuffed and the walls were dirty. For this to be a few year old hotel - it's not being kept up to par. I can only imagine what it'll look like in the next few years. YUCK! I contacted management - I stated our room wasn't clean and it wasn't the same as shown in the pictures online. He mentioned that our room was thoroughly cleaned and all of the rooms were different - well maybe they need a disclosure on their website. I was so shocked by this response. He said the hotel was pretty booked up, but he'll see what other options are available.

I waited 2.5 hours - contacted the front desk and the agent said they're booked to capacity and that the manager mentioned he told me just that. If that was the case, I wouldn't have waited around. The staff, especially the manager doesn't understand hospitality much. 

I have worked in the industry in my younger years for 5 years and still work in customer relations - The staff at Villa Bagatelle certainly do not care about building rapport or earning future business.

I contacted Expedia and within an hour - my family and I were on our merry way. We stayed at Grand Beach Hotel Surfside, which I strongly recommend. As soon as I walked into this hotel, there was an airy aaaahhh feeling.

I guess all things happen for a reason, but I will never stay at Villa Bagatelle.",2.0,Sandra M,2015-07-18,,Family,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"I have stayed at many fine hotels before and just over looked the service that they give for the price I have paid, a lot of simple things you just expect from a higher priced hotel. In this case paying around 400.00 a night while staying in PH2 I did not find those things in place here . when I arrived it was raining and got no help from the doorman just told me check in was over there. check in was easy no issues I was asked when would I want my breakfast to my room I told them 9am would be great , gave my car key to him for the 35.00 dollar a day fee . I went back to my car where my girlfriend and her sister were waiting for me, no one offered help with our bags so I just took them by myself , when entering the room it was nice and clean no issues there. The view from the roof top terrace was not great from PH2 I also noticed that there were no chairs on the balcony and the pics I see on site showed them I called desk and they gave me 2 chairs . after walking around the beach it was time to rest and we discover there was only 2 bath towels in the room and we booked for 3 people why would they not have  3 knowing we booked for 3 people. the next morning time to hit the beach waiting for our 9am breakfast at 930 I called and said where is it and they had no answer also said 2 beach towels were in the room but there was none I called and they did bring to us. as the day before doorman not helpful just talking to other workers . stayed 3 nights and no night down service until the last night , went to the pool there  the chaise lounges really need a cleaning there are so dirty someone needs to pressure wash them ,also must say the room was set at 70 degree but at night the ac cut off and every morning it was 75 why cut ac down at night . I also called for my car and after 3 minutes no one answered so we just went down and waited 10 minutes to get it, and for safety reasons as this world is crazy no there was not a peep hole to see who is at the door",4.0,David C,2015-07-24,,Couple,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"I have just returned after a weeks vacation at the Boulan in South Beach Miami with my son and daughter.  We rented the one bedroom with a sitting area with a full kitchen and a terrace.  My son is 29 years of age and he slept on the pull couch and my daughter 16 and I in the king bedroom.  Firstly the space is fabulous, 1000 sq feet and a huge terrace, so there's no shortage of room to move and enjoy.  The layout was modern and artistic, quite chic and the bathroom gorgeous.  The pullout mattress was not good and not comfortable unfortunately, which for a weeks stay for my son was not so great, but he endured.  I don't recommend two sleeping on it although there was room.  Our bed mattress curved down on either side, but other than that it was ok.  The sheets were clean and soft and the the bed was a king so we had plenty of room.  The fridge made a terrible grinding noise on and off and although I did have it looked at the noise never went away. It kept me awake at times.  The terrace, though huge had a rather shabby looking table and couch on it which was rather disappointing as it's such a lovely space and they could have made it fabulous.......we only sat out there once and had to bring chairs from inside out.  As for the kitchen, though very clean was sparse in regards to utensils.....very limited supply of stuff so if you are there with a family of four you will need to call and talk to the front desk.  The pool area was lovely although it felt a little unloved and in need of some care........it was hardly used, maybe that's why, but it was on the roof and great views.....The staff were very friendly and accommodating and the location was a short walk form their restaurant, Orange Blossom that offered a continental breakfast free with the booking and a great menu.  Orange Blossom was fabulous service and great food and our favourite place, we made friends with all the staff and it felt like a home away from home.  It made our stay at Boulan. The location of the hotel is a ten minuet walk from all the great hot spots, cafes, restaurants, hotels and Ocean Drive and five mins to the beach.  You do however have to pay $10 a day for an umbrella on the beach which I felt was a rip off and should have been included with the two loungers that come with the hotel.  There was also a resort fee per day that is not included in the price when booking so be prepared to pay at  least an additional $250 for the week.  All in all a great spot for families who are in need of a larger space.....simply gorgeous and spacious and a plus if you want to eat in.........two flat screen TVs and free wifi although it was frustratingly inconsistant.  I had a fabulous trip and would consider going back if travelling with family, but when you rent an apartment you don't have the luxury of a bar with music, or loungy places to sit where's theres life and activity, it's just an apartment.  You can't eat or drink and the pool side so its a very different experience but it's a lot cheaper too, although Boulan is a five star.  I hope this helps.

tripadvisor,"Villa Bagatelle is a very nice hotel. Our room was excellent - good size, comfortable beds and quiet. The pool areas on the room is a true aset after a full days walk around town.
The work out room is small but include the equipment you need for a good work out.

The location on South Beach, close to the Beach is good.

It has all the ingredients for beeing a top hotel If you want to avoid the large and sterile hotel chains.

However, they miss on the details...
Arriving by car and the Valet parking was somewhat of a chaos. 20 min after arrival, we got to check in.
Not enough towels in the room. It took two visits to the reception, two hours a part to get them sent to our room.
Bringing breakfast to the room is perfect but having yesterdays bread is not what you expect. Having the breakfast outside on the balcony is nice but not if the furniture is so dirty it risk to stain your clothes. In addition - about one third of the plants are dead and there are cigarette buts in them..

Work on the details dear management on you get a higher score. :-)
This is a hotell with very nice potential,",8.0,Keja60,2015-08-03,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"We stayed at this hotel from 7/31 through 8/3.  All the rooms are suites and very well appointed.  We stayed in room 408 - it was about 1100 SF with nice furnishings, marble floors, and nicely decorated.  The kitchen was stocked w/dishes, paper towels, dishwashing detergent, etc.  There was ample closet space and everything was very spacious.  They provide robes, 2 beach towels, a safe, Bigalow toiletries.  The bed and linens were extremely comfortable - lovely Frette sheets & towels.  Very luxurious. Wifi was fast with no issues. There is also a washer and dryer in the apartment - we didn't do laundry but did use the dryer to dry swimsuits from the morning on the day we were leaving.

The pool was on the roof and serviceable.  Our 4-year old son had fun - there are a steps along both sides of the pool so plenty of space for little ones to play.  The beach service is provided by the The Raleigh a few blocks down the road.  2 lounge chairs are provided but you have to order an umbrella separately for $19.  The food & beverage service was excellent & starts at 11ish - Edwin, our server, was very attentive & supernice.  There appears to be a small sand area for kids to play but you may want to bring a small bag of beach toys if you want your child to be able to play in the sand near your chair.  We had brunch at the Raleigh one morning on their patio and highly recommend it.  Great service & food.  We returned early one morning on the way to the beach - the Raleigh has a small coffee bar in the front of the hotel lobby & is a great place to grab a coffee to take on the beach.

We didn't have much luck at restaurants at the Villa Bagatelle.  Note, they do NOT offer room service, so after arriving our first night in Miami Beach we were directed to the Bagatell restaurant - around 9p - with our 4 year old son.  Like many restaurants in SB the restaurant/lounge played very loud music so we opted to sit outside in their small patio where there seems to be some sort of sewer issue so not a great experience.  The food was actually fairly well prepared & the service was good but note there are no options for children aside from pomme frites.  

We tried to go the Orange Blossom for brunch one day but they had a kitchen malfunction and closed early.  One nice thing about the hotel is the complimentary continental breakfast.  This came w/yogurt, fruit, orange juice and an assortment of pastries.  This was very welcomed and appreciated - a great start to the day.  Instead of a coffee machine they provide an espresso machine.  Ours was not working well - it appeared to be clogged and required pushing the button about 12 times to get a full (tiny) cup of espresso.  Aside from the coffee bar in the Raleigh I wasn't aware of any other nearby coffee options if you prefer a latte or coffee in the morning.  

Staff at the hotel was very pleasant and friendly.  We were disappointed when the first day our room wasn't cleaned.  We were gone from about 10 to 3p & the room had not been cleaned.  We left around 6p for about 3 hours- making certain to let the front desk know we would be gone & requested the room be cleaned.  When we returned the room had not been visited.  Staff was very quick about bringing fresh towels, coffee, & toiletries to get us through the evening.

There are some lovely common areas in the hotel but note - there is no bar or restaurant services.  There is a Walgreens just a couple of blocks away which is a convenient location to stock up on snacks and wine.

If you're traveling with smaller kids - consider visiting the beach early in the morning and also in the evening.  We walked along the beach walk & on the beach one evening - the weather was much cooler w/out sun and it was far less crowded.  Also, the tide is out in the evening and the waves aren't as large.  The early morning hours - before all of the chairs & umbrellas are set up is also very peaceful - it's a nice way to start the morning before the hot sun and crowds come out in full force.  Also, be sure to walk south along the beach walk - there is a nice playground near around 12th street.

Overall, this hotels provides fantastic value and plenty of space for traveling families.  Although not a full service hotel - it provides a very pleasant, comfortable home base to enjoy Miami Beach.  We would definitely stay here again!",8.0,susan f,2015-08-03,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"The hotel is well situated about 2 blocks from the beach, but to have access to the lounge chairs of that hotel hotel, it's a longer walk. Service was horrible, we had to call multiple times a day for them to bring us clean towels, toilet paper and clean sheets. I thought toilet paper was the basic, but apparently it's on demand in that hotel. Room were nice but not clean well at all. Shower was so dirty it had stuff growing in the corners. The roof top lounge and pool were nice, but don't go there looking for any ambiance, as the bar is closed due to their lack of alcohol license. it was pretty much deserted.  Their security was also awful, we had a group of people running and smashing doors and screaming drunk in the hallways at 3-4am, for like an hour, and no one ever told them anything.

I loved how big the room was, there was an open kitchen and a great refrigerator as well as an oven and a microwave because there is no food service at the hotel. BUT- the very famous Bagatelle of NYC is located right next to the entrance of the Hotel, and to be honest, I had the best French toast I have ever eaten in my life. The rooms were not as clean as I would want to, I had to call the front desk and warn them, but after that they payed special attention. There were a balcony in front of our room, and then a staircase inside the room takes you up to your private terrace with a lounge. You can also reach the pool in seconds from your own terrace.

tripadvisor,"I chose this hotel based mainly on a promotional price and overall good reviews on various websites. If I went back, I would choose this hotel again based on the wonderful room and location. We stayed in the Suite King, which is one of their smallest rooms I believe. Well it was not small by far and more than enough space for 2 people. I was so impressed by the size and layout that I had to check my reservation to make sure I booked the right suite. The rooms were clean, the bathroom was nice and our balcony was huge. The balcony probably could've been a bit tidier (a few plants were out of place and the table could use a wipe down), but we were so amazed to have so much outdoor space, we hardly noticed. And even though it wasn't an ocean view room, we could see the ocean pretty clearly. 

The common areas were also nice. We walked around the rooftop pool and thought it was just a fantastic view (although we were a little disappointed not to have an ocean view). Also the gardens and fountains were nice and serene. 

The staff was great. We're pretty low maintenance, so didn't have much interaction, but they seemed friendly, the doorman always gave us a friendly greeting as we came and went, and the bellhop was very helpful in storing our luggage while we ate breakfast and with hailing us a cab.

Lastly, I thought the location was good. It's a little north of most of the action in South Beach. But, its an easy walk down Collins or Ocean Ave to the heart of South Beach and there's a lot to see and do along the way. (We ate dinner at OLA, a great restaurant a few blocks away and thought it was fantastic.) And it's only a block away from the beach.

I am so happy that I discovered Villa Bagatelle this winter and I already stayed twice since January. The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of South Beach, close to the beach, Lincoln road and the Convention center. All the rooms are double the size of an average Miami hotel. They are all set as luxury residential apartments with marble floors and bathrooms, and all the modern amenities. I love the Frette linen and the comfortable beds and pillows - so great for a good night sleep!
The roof top swimming pool and Jacuzzi are my favorite - usually is pretty peaceful and relaxing up there and the sunsets are absolutely stunning!
Since they opened the Bagatelle restaurant on the ground floor - you have as well a fantastic restaurant where you can have a fun dinner with friends or a party brunch in the afternoon.

tripadvisor,"Just returned from our first stay at the Boulan and we like it very much, we have comparison's to the hotels in South beach as we have stayed at many of them.My husband and I agree that In any of  the other hotels we have stayed none have rooms as large as the ""Boulan"". With a full kitchen including utensils, huge bathroom, nice well decorated living area with a sofa that converts to a bed and sliding doors that separate the living area to the bedroom. This is a great space for people who have children or a  friend coming to visit ( which we had on one of the days)
The parking is expensive $35 dollars a night, and believe me we looked for other parking spaces and other than meters they all ran about the same price.( we did the math)
The staff, valets and everyone who worked at this hotel are extremely friendly!
The only thing I didn't care for much is the pool area, which is on the roof along with a lounge area. There is no bar, no DJ, not even background  music, no food ...its DEAD! .... and  Is probably the reason why its not attracting a huge younger crowd ...Which is good for couple's like us, but not when they are subjected to being hit with balls being thrown around the pool by families who didn't care if there children ran wild 
 There is no- staff checking the pool area so people with children( some of them) just let them run free.Our experience with these families was that they were throwing balls across the pool , twice hitting me in the stomach with the ball ,and drenching me while screaming and playing games with there parents( who when I looked at a parent and said can you please be careful  they just ignored me and carried on playing). on the second and third day when they arrived, my husband and  I  left the pool.
.I think management should send someone up to check on the pool area. Or post a sign. Saying ""no running in pool area"" ..or ""please respect your fellow guests""..
The Free breakfast  was ok, seeing most hotels don't offer it it can be though if as a plus.The free breakfast ends at 10am. There is no restaurant in the hotel , so for your free breakfast you have to go out onto Collins ave and into a restaurant called ""orange blossom""  We ended up ordering from the regular menu, as the free menu was extremely limited. Nice restaurant though. With great pancakes.
Bottom line: great hotel and spacious rooms. Big bang for your buck. But because of the extra sleeping areas( pull out beds) it seems to attract many people with kids,Which I have no problem with... but at the pool area.

They call it a sea view and it is but not as up close as one might imagine. But it is near enough for me and allows a great view of the vibrant day and night time South Beach crowd as they promenade the Avenue .  

The view from the rooftop pool is spectacular as is the stunning oriental fresco that is the poolside signature piece.

I always self cater so don't use the breakfast vouchers and can't comment on the restaurant where you go to use them.  

I know some people are surprised by the resort fee that is charged on arrival. I have to say I wish the hotel would simply build it into the room rate as I think it can sour the stay's start if you don't realize it's there.   

The bathrooms are fabulous, the walk in closet a joy and the kitchen terrific in terms of white goods - although maybe a little more in terms of utensils and pans would be welcome. I would definitely recommend putting in scissors as travelers can no longer take them on planes and may need them on arrival. 

The position is perfect and there is a bus stop seconds from the hotel with frequent buses that take you directly to various shopping areas like Bal Harbour - very much cheaper and just as easy as a cab.

The staff are friendly yet leave you alone and don't bang on your door to clean the room when your sign is up asking not to be disturbed.  

If you want to get your hair done then I can highly recommend the salon at the W on the opposite side of the road to the left. Philomena is terrific.

The Staff at the front desk was outstanding. They were extremely helpful and even offered to hold our luggage free of charge upon our return from our cruise.

If i have to give any negative feedback it would be the pull out couch. We were traveling with two teenage girls so we had to use the couch. We had no sheets nor blankets - the front desk quickly supplied it, but the springs on this ""mattress"" were a killer - they were literally popping out.

At first glance, the room was very nice.  My colleague and I had the Standard Suite which was 1000 sqft with a great kitchen and marble bathroom.

     When we arrived the bed was not made. On my way out for dinner I stopped by the front desk, and requested turndown service for the sofa bed. I had a meeting early the next morning and wanted to get a good night sleep.  Later that night when I returned, the bed was neither made, nor were there sheets/pillows for me to make it myself.  When I tried to call the front desk I discovered that the phone was not working.  After having to walk back downstairs the person at the front desk told me that there was no one there that could make the bed for that at that time.  He handed me an empty duvet case cover and a pillow and sent me back upstairs.  I have slept on many sofa beds; however, this was by far the most uncomfortable.  It took me until 3am to fall asleep because I was able to feel the thick metal bars through the thin mattress.  
     At 4am the fire alarm when off in the entire building.  It was incredibly frustrating as the false alarm continued for over a half hour. 
     When I returned to my room at 5am the room was almost 80 degree.  The Air Conditioning stopped working.  The front desk told me they would fix it the next day.  I got one hour of sleep the entire night making me half delirious in my meeting..
     The next night I returned from a long day to find that the air conditioning still had not been fixed.  It was near impossible to sleep again because I was rolling in a hot sweat.  I addressed these problems many times to the front desk and no one seemed to care.  I asked multiple times to be switched to another room, but was told none were available.
    The last day my flight was cancelled, and out of desperation, I asked if there were any rooms available for one more night and if they could possibly give me a discount.  Not only did they not give me a discount, but they also raised the rate by over 50%.  I was forced to move all my stuff out and stay at another hotel.

The hotel has a lot of potential as it is in a great location and has done quality renovations. The customer service and the efficacy of it new appliances are the worst I have ever experienced.
My recommendation to management would be to hire and train better employees.  Give new customers better deals/upgrades so that they return and tell their friends. Raise the prices and start a high class pool party which it has the facilities for.  There were quite a few weirdos hanging out at the pool.  The hotel could easily command a much higher price if it works out its kinks.",2.0,chrome191,2015-03-22,,Group,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"This ""hotel"" had terrible service!  It's actually two-hotels-in-one and very disorganized.
The room was alright although a little dirty in places like the closets.  Also little things like the towel hook behind the bathroom door was missing.
The pool area was disgusting.  Garbage, old/rusty lounges and stained cushions, lack of towels.  There was NO service at the pool so you had to use the phone by the elevator to ask for towels or order food.
Definitely not a family hotel.
I would NOT recommend Villa Bagatelle.",2.0,ctyankee20,2015-03-29,,Family,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"We really enjoyed our stay at Villa Bagatelle. It helped that I had read the reviews beforehand and did not expect a full-service hotel. This appears to be a transition stage with Villa Bagatelle and the Boulan currently co-existing. At present Villa Bagatelle offers more of an apart-hotel experience - there is no in-house restaurant/bar for breakfast or lunch, although there is a very nice restaurant, Orange Blossom, at street-level (delicious quinoa fried rice on Brunch menu). The newly-opened Bagatelle restaurant is part of the building but there is no direct access from within the hotel and no reference to it in the rooms. On the Villa Bagatelle website, the hotel refers to the Rooftop and the Bagatelle Garden offering food/drinks and coming in the Spring. But when I asked, no one had a definite timeline as to when they were opening. For our part, we were more than happy to look after ourselves. We were traveling with 2 grown-up children and were looking for somewhere on/near the beach with plenty of room to spend quality family time together out of the sun (I know, a crime in Miami but Irish skins...). The presidential suite was everything promised in terms of size and furnishings. The photos on the website are entirely accurate and the view was spectacular. The noise levels are to be expected given you are on Collins Ave and near several nightspots but we are sensitive to this and we slept well thanks to very effective noise-reducing windows. The lobby area and check-in process could be improved but the staff were always friendly (thanks to Scander especially who was in touch throughout our stay). We did have to ask for some things in the apartment but they were delivered promptly. It does feel as if the hotel is finding its way, especially with housekeeping, but again, knowing before we arrived that this is a new departure for the Bagatelle group prepared us for this. Beach service is with The Raleigh and during our week there we were very well looked after by Alvaro. A little more time to allow for housekeeping to find its rhythm and for the new eating and drinking areas to open and I am sure it would be impossible for us to book the Villa Bagatelle. As it is now, it is a great option if you are looking for a marvelous location and rooms with a sense of style and spaciousness. Plus, thanks to the Illy machines, the luxury of being able to enjoy a freshly-made espresso coffee in your room, any time of the day - or night (they provide decaf coffee as well!)",8.0,where_next2b,2015-04-06,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"We booked a holiday to Florida and started off in Miami. We arrived at the Boulan after 21 hours of no sleep at around midnight, but unfortunately we didn't realise it was the last day of spring break. We hoped to be there for some of it but the last night on our first night meant lots of noise. Even a sleeping pill and ear plugs could not help here as the location is right on the road.

The suit/apartment was gorgeous and spacious, but a little tired in areas but this did not matter. The bathroom and kitchen were fantastic and probably great for people who want to save money and cook.

The rooftop pool is nice but the photos on the website make it look a lot cleaner but it was fine for sunbathing and cooling down. you can get towels for the pool but we had to find someone in the hotel to ask to get some for us and we were not the only ones who struggled to find this out. they should leave information in your room so you know what to do. On check in we were not given any information of the hotel either.

South beach is only a 3 minute walk across the road.

There is no drinks or food service here and breakfast is served at Orange Blossom around the corner which was pleasant. Service is not the best but the food was lovely.

tripadvisor,"I should have known how our stay would go based on my initial contact (or lack thereof) with the hotel front desk. I called the hotel to ask about amenities three times and the phone rang off the hook. It took an email for them to finally call me back. Villa Bagatelle is far from a full service (or partial service, in my opinion) hotel. You would think they would want to be honest with a potential guest about that prior to booking, espcially if the guest is calling in advance about amenitites. But no. When I booked our Easter weekend stay back in late February, the hotel claimed they would be adding food service to their rooftop pool in early March. Not only was there no food service for our stay, but the guest services were the least helpful I have ever come across. When I called to ask about food at the pool the answer I got was ""Um. Well. Um. We don't do that, but there is, um, a phone up on the roof you can use to call Orange Blossom (No explanation of WTH that is) and, IF THEY ARENT BUSY, they might deliver to the roof. UM."" That is not even a real answer! Requesting towels for the beach or the pool meant 20 minutes of waiting around for them- the hotel is not large and does not seem to be understaffed, the staff just moves at a glacial pace with little consideration for the guests plans. The 24/7 doorman literally just opened and closed the door. When we asked about getting a cab (several times), they pointed down the street to Collins Ave, and said ""that's your best bet."" The beach service at the Raleigh (while I understand VB can't do anything about this) was very frustrating. One waiter for the whole beach. He was an incredibly hard worker and we give him serious props for high-tailing it back and forth from the Raliegh, but it was ridiculous how long we had to wait to order/get our food or drinks. On the Saturday we hit the beach at 2 pm and they told us they only had 1 chair left. Absurd. To be fair, the Villa Bagatelle room was large, and the bed was very comfortable. But the lack of furniture filling the space made the large room seem slightly tacky. You can tell they cut corners. Overall, I would have been more happier with my stay had I not paid only $30 less a night than the Raleigh was offering, and had we known what do expect from the start as far as hotel service. Lesson learned, we will not be frequenting Villa Bagatelle again.",4.0,Katie B,2015-04-09,,Couple,7.4,1201

We had just checked in..why was this not fixed prior to check in or after we checked out the next day?  We had not complained about anything needing to be fixed, seemed a little shady like they were checking out what was in our room.  Later that night around 10 pm the fire alarm went off....twice.  With an announcement to disregard the alarm...were they doing a random check?  If so, why that late at night?  Finally, the straw that broke the camels back was when I went to check out and found out that they had authorized someones valet who was NOT staying in my room onto my account.  No one called me before charging my card..I had never authorized another valet on my account and for all I know it could have been a random person who picked a random room to valet his car on for the night.

tripadvisor,"We`ve stayed overnight at Boulan, considering that it was supposed to be a beach hotel and well located in Miami Beach. However, our experience was very bad. We arrived late at night, and didn`t receive the information that before going to the beach I was supposed to go through the reception and claim a paper. So, we went (just to stay 30 minutes at the beach, before checking out) and the guy was rude. Obviously, it was not worth it to go back at the reception (the hotel is not in the beach, but a good walk away), considering our time limitation. The wifi didn`t worked at all also. When I reported to the managerial staff that we didn`t use any amenities offered by the hotel, she insisted in charging an extra U$ 40 as a resort fee!!!! Very abusive price, considering that I didn`t use any resort service!!!
The bellboy and other supporting staff are very polite. My critiques are related to the reservation manager that show no respect for the costumer quality of hotel stay.
The hotel is supposed to be modern and has a good room design. However, there is no maintenance and things are deteriorating. 
The official photos mislead, because the hotel is far away from the beach and the entrance is not even located in Lincoln St.

tripadvisor,"First, let me say, it isn't located on 2000 Collins Ave, it's actually on 21st street. Upon arriving, way after check in, midnight, there were two men at the check in desk.  They were casually dressed, so at first it seemed shady.  There was questions we had that they couldn't answwe right away, and answers that were unsure of. Anyways, we had two young toddlers with us and booker, one of the guys, was fantastic help.  He brought everything up for us and we had a lot of stuff.  

The room was exactly how it was pictured.  Loved the kitchenette.  Dishwasher, stove, microwave, full fridge, it had everything. Just missing a sponge to wash the dishes. The room overall was very nice. 
We ordered a crib for the room for my young daughter and it is almost a full size crib. It was awesome to have! Love that they had that option. 
Their pool on the rooftop isn't heated but they do have a hot tub. They have cabana style beds and lounge chairs as well. Which makes this hotel stand out.  They have their own private beach as well. When you want to go to the beach, you go downstairs and they'll give you two vouchers for chairs and umbrella
There isn't any parking only valet, and that is $36 a night. We didn't get to wake up early enough for the free breakfast but it isn't in the Boulan hotel it is actually in another hotel. One around the corner. 
The bell boys for the rest of the stay weren't as great as booker, sometimes they didn't even offer to help with our bags. The service we got from the one help that TUESDAY night we checked in was awesome. Every other night till Saturday morning was ehh...

The hotel seems to be brand new. They were still finishing up exterior painting. The hotel is on 21 & Collins. There are 2 hotels side by side that use the same lobby and check in so it can get a bit confusing. the location is excellent.

They had a illy coffee machine. There is a pool deck on top. The only issue I had was wifi as it would not work well in my room but worked great in the lobby. Wifi is free. I believe Valet is $35.

tripadvisor,"If there is one thing you pull out of this review it would be this:  You don't need a hotel ON THE BEACH to have a great South Beach experience.  We came to the Boulan Hotel and immediately loved the location on 21st Street and Collins Ave.  Although this hotel doesn't sit on the physical beach, it is only across the street and offers full service. 

There are so many things going for this hotel that I just have to share.  We arrived on Monday night for our 2 night stay and were greeted by 2 doorman that could not have been more nice.  Even though we only had one bag, they offered assistance and gave us a friendly and warm welcome.  We checked in at the desk where they assigned our rooms, explained the hotel services and even included complimentary breakfast for our stay.  At first I thought it was strange that the restaurant entrance was around the corner (The Orange Blossom) but when we actually went, we loved the decor as well as the food.  Simply charming!  

When we checked into our room we couldn't believe this was their basic room.  Our room was located on the 2nd floor (208) and when you walk in, you are walking into what is essentially a one bedroom apartment!  The entry way has a guest bath and you walk into a huge living room and full size kitchen.  The modern clean design was fun and spirited with pops of color, art and a contemporary feel.  It was recently renovated and the finishes were fantastic.  The bedroom featured a king size bed and there was a balcony/patio that could be accessed either from the bedroom or the living room.  There are 2 large flat screens, a Bluetooth stereo to play your music and free WiFi.  

The bathroom was pretty awesome and featured beautiful full marble floors and walls, a very large shower with rain shower fixtures and a separate deep soaking bathtub.  There are his and his sinks and plenty of closet space that is fit for a long term stay.  The bathrobes, bath amenities, full size mirrors and spacious layout we all thoughtful and appreciated.  

The hotel has a great pool on the rooftop that is just beautiful with great views.  There is plenty of seating and great for lounging.  

The only slightly odd observation is that the hotel still uses hard keys compared to the electronic locks you see in most hotels.  It doesn't really matter or affect ones stay, it was just something that I noticed.  The only true bad thing about my stay was the fact that I had to leave.

The staff was very helpful and very pleasant -- they really enhanced our stay.

The terrace was from wall to wall, the entire width of the room.  Walk in closet was a great plus!

tripadvisor,"This could be a wonderful hotel but there are some issues. Firstly, it very much feels like an apartment block. The bar&restaurant are separate from the main building and the pool is on the top floor. The reception staff are however very friendly. Onto the amenities:
Firstly, the pool area is quite small and there are only 4 double, shaded cabana beds. The single loungers around the pool are not shaded as there are no umbrellas. Also, during our 5 day stay the area was not cleaned once. There were dirty nappies, plastic bottles, used plasters, etc.. around the pool and the bins never emptied. 
If your rate includes breakfast you need to walk around the block to their small bar/restaurant by 10am. There is always a queue. The choice is very limited. There are 3 items: pancakes, yoghurt&granola or scrambled eggs with potatoes and 1 piece of toast. You choose either coffee or orange juice. The portions are very small.
The rooms at first looks great. They have an all white, designer look. Very spacious, separate living/kitchen area with separate toilet and washing/drying machine. Big fridge freezer with icemaker. Very large comfortable bed, 2 closets, and very large bathroom with rain shower (no bath).
BUT: the sofa bed is extremely uncomfortable. The fridge freezer is very loud so it keeps you awake during the night. The rain shower has very little pressure and the Wifi only works in the living area. The floors do not get swept so after 5 days it felt very dirty.
When you are paying 5* hotel prices you expect 5* service and amenities.
Either address the issues or drop your prices.",8.0,Msfluffy,2014-08-15,,,7.4,1201

I tried it for a few minutes and must admit not good. we complained to reception and they brought a mattress to place over it but to not benefit. they than delivered a single fold away which was the same but only smaller. I gave some feedback to management on checkout that they need to invest in some new and better fold outs. it came with breakfast in a nice eatery around the corner with a simple breakfast. it is one street back from the ocean but they have their own beach area with umbrellas and lounges at no extra cost. the hotel was clean and the staff were friendly. they were doing some works near the entrance which looks like it may become a bar/restaurant but no noise bothered us.

tripadvisor,"We stayed in a 1 bedroom terrace suite recently during September of this year. The hotel was nice and with plenty of room for the 4 of us. The room was about 1100 sq feet with a huge bathroom with a large glass-door shower, separate tub, and dual sinks along with a separate enclosed toilet. The bedroom had a comfy king-size bed, 2 large closet spaces, and a huge flat screen tv mounted on the wall. The living room also had the same size flat screen tv mounted on the wall, 2 modern chairs and a pull out sofa couch (which was like laying on a rock) with access to a decent size terrace. The only problem with the terrace is the left over cigarette buds all over the floor and dirty, unwashed cushions lining the chairs. Unfortunately the terrace walls were too high to really get a view of the beach. There was a full kitchen with fridge, dishwasher, stove, microwave, kitchen table and even a wine chiller along with provided dishes, cups, and utensils. However, the fridge was basically a stocked mini bar and no free coffee or tea was provided which was odd. There was another bathroom with a poorly designed sink and even a washer and dryer in a closet next to the door. The place had a modern, urban feel to it and the decor was beautiful. They provided us with 2 free tickets to complementary breakfast at the Orange Blossom daily, a coupon for 15% off dinner at the Orange Blossom, and a ticket for 2 free chair rentals at the beach daily. The complementary breakfast at the Orange Blossom was very limited with 3 options (eggs, potatoes & toast, pancakes, or a yogurt parfait) and the service was terrible. The staff at the actual hotel were wonderful but the staff at the beach were very rude, unprofessional, and harassing. Unfortunately, they made a big seen when my friends and I wanted to move up from our second row section of chairs to the first row when the couple who was sitting there took all their stuff and left. After that highly embarrassing incident of the staff shouting at us and ""making their job difficult"" because we wanted a better view, we never used our complimentary beach chairs again. We did voice our concerns to the hotel management but nothing was done to pacify the ugly incident that occurred. All in all, the stay was pretty decent. The hotel was across from the beach and close to Lincoln road and Ocean Dr. We were able to walk to pretty much everywhere since we were on 21th and Collins.

tripadvisor,"Many other reviewers have praised this place, and rightly so. To be clear, this is a boutique hotel, not a ""one-of-a-million-standardized-hotel-chain-experience"", which may not fit with everyone. Neither is it a hotel hiding behind the term ""boutique"" to cover for shabby service, run down rooms or alike. While it is not five star in my book, it is a very solid four star establishment. 

Among its many benefits are:
- great lounch area/open air atrium at lobby.
- really nice staff at the reception.
- enormous rooms (we hade one with a open plan kitchen+living room, separate bedroom, a guest toilet and a bath room (shower and bath tub) of the size of a NYC-studio, plus balcony).
- good sized pool on the roof, plus many sunbeds, a bar and a lounch area.
- great location, one block from the beach (which is on a nice and quieter part of it) plus walking distance to the main shopping street.

We travelled with our small kids and, for us, the hotel, the room and the location were perfect.

Now, there are some things to perhaps keep in mind (also to avoid being disappointed by the exaggerated five star classification):
- cleaning could have been better (not a big problem, we simply asked them to do it and problem solved, bit still...).
- kitchen works ok, but pots and pans are run down and there is a rather limited set of tableware.
- some of the furniture in the kitchen needed repair.
- the breakfast is served in a nearby café/resto (not a problem in itself), where service - compared to the hotel - is NOT impressive. The café also provides the room service at the hotel and, frankly, was not providing dishes of quality (we tried two salads for lunch and decided quickly not to do it again).
- the sun beds on the beach were pretty old and there was a ridiculous rule that guests from Boulqn could not use the sun beds closest to the ocean (although it hardly matters much, since it only implies an additional 10 meters to the waterfront).

Notwithstanding these ""issues"", I would recommend this place, especially for travellers with (small) kids. We would certainly stay at Boulan again, if/when returning to Miami.",8.0,joreSwedeinBrussels,2014-05-11,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I went with my family and stayed for almost one week in early april. First of all, the apartment was very spacious and fresh. Say goodbye to small hotel rooms! Specially if you travel with small kids you need enough room (since even if you want to, you cannot stay the whole day at the beach with the little ones). The location was great (close to beach and close to the shopping/city area). The swimming-pool on the roof was fabulous! It had stairs which is very handy for the kids. The service was super: the ""doormen"" in the lobby were very helpful and Alex + Jessica in the reception were super nice and service-minded in a warm, natural way.

Although my blessing words above, I do have some suggestions for improvement:
Better, attentive cleaning. Overall was the cleaning of our apartment just ok.
More tools in the kitchen: more plates, more cutlery etc. The kitchen equipment in our apartment was a little bit poor.

tripadvisor,"This is less a full service hotel, than a condo complex, with units that are rented out.  We had some issues from the get go - requesting towels and more sheets that never arrived.  2 out of 3 nights we had a 2:30 AM and a 3:30 AM fire alarm.  The first night, we trekked out to be told by the night front desk that there was no fire.  He couldn't have been less reactive to the alarm, just said, ""it's nothing"".  We didn't even bother getting out of bed for the second night.   This was totally disruptive.  I would imagine this happens frequently.

There is a club downstairs in the hotel, that is open until 4 or 5 am.  You will hear the bass and music in your hotel room if you are in rooms 210 or 209.  We had a pregnant woman in our group that was unable to sleep due to the bass pounding through the room, however, with a few drinks, the rest of the group was able to sleep through the noise.  (So this might depend on who is in your group!)  However, when we brought this issue up to the front desk, the manager was very gracious about moving us.

The rooms themselves are great - spacious and clean.  Perfect for a girls weekend for four.  The hotel is centrally located to the Setai, Delano, etc.  The pool lacks a bit - took about 30 minutes to get drinks up there, so we only went the once.  

Overall, we were underwhelmed by this hotel.  It was a great deal for what we got, and the day service was excellent.  However, the pool lacked, and the night manager wasn't helpful at all.",6.0,yolanda3268,2014-06-02,,Group,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I would not stay at this hotel again.

The hotel day staff was incredibly helpful and it's location a block away from the beach was great.  The young female manager was particularly helpful and very apologetic. The hotel is connected to a night club and it is very loud if you want to try and get some sleep. You have to get a room that is on a high floor. The fire alarm also went off on two nights (at 3:30 and 2:30 am) during our three night stay there. The night manager was of no help when we checked in and also when the alarm went off multiple times. 

The pool on the roof is okay. There are no cushions on the day beds and the towels were few and far between. We ordered a round of drinks and it took 45 minutes, and the drinks were not that good. The waitress was chatting with some guy the whole time and seemed otherwise engaged.

The room is the exception, as it's a full one bedroom apartment vs. a hotel room. There was plenty of space for me and three friends during our girls weekend and having one and a half bathrooms was also really nice.",4.0,Holly W,2014-06-02,,Group,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"During our 3 night stay, there were two separate fire alarms on Thursady and Saturday in the middle of the night, one at 2:30AM and one at 3:30 AM. We had to run down 5 flights of stairs to go to the lobby, only for some rude front desk receptionist to tell us this was a false alarm and had to do with the club connected to the hotel. Aside from this, we received no apologies for being woken up in a frenzy two separate evenings. We also had issues with chairs for the beach. They only gave us 4, for a 6 person suite. Our phones in our room did not work as well, and we were told to use our cell phones if we needed anything from the front desk. While the room was modern and nice, the service was just so poor, I would definitely not stay there again. They also did not give us a late check out for after 12, and had NOWHERE to shower, no locker rooms, nothing. So we all ended up changing in the public restroom in the tiny lobby for about an hour or so before our departure. Also, the Happy Hour deal was a rip off, and took 30 minutes to get one drink, so we didn't have an opportunity to take advantage of the reduced pricing. They also screwed up our orders for both the food and drinks, and also ran out of foods for both breakfast and dinner (This was at Orange Blossom connected to the hotel)",2.0,Michelle D,2014-06-05,,Group,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I stayed at the Boulan this past weekend with 5 girlfriends for a bachelorette party. We stayed in the Luxury Two Bedroom Suite, and the room was great! Full kitchen, 2.5 bathrooms (one very large), huge terrace...it was exactly what we were looking for, + more. The rooftop pool was perfect, and the service at the pool was top notch (only good service we came across all weekend). The location of the hotel was ideal (right across the street from the Seagull & W), with easy access to the beach. 

We had two very big complaints. First- the room is advertised as a 6 person suite, which is how many people we had. So imagine our confusion when they only provided us with enough chairs at the beach for 4 people. We had to pay an extra $30 at the beach to get the additional two chairs. When we would ask at the front desk for 2 more chairs, they were rude and dismissive. They should 100% be providing a chair for each person in the room. 

The second complaint- we were there for 3 nights, and 2 of those nights the fire alarm went off! Not just an ordinary fire alarm, a VERY LOUD one, with a women speaking- ""Can I have your attention please, Can I have your attention please, a fire has been reported in the building, a fire has been reported in the building, please proceed to leave the building using the stairs, do not use the elevator...WOMP!! WOMP!! WOMP!! WOMP!!""...and was repeated many times. The first time it happened it was 4am in the morning, we all raced to get dressed, and had to run down the stairs. People were carrying screaming babies down the as well! When we got to the lobby, a hotel employee very nonchalantly was telling people it was a false alarm, someone smoked a cigarette in the adjoining nightclub, and we could all go back upstairs. He did not even apologize. When we went down the next morning, the people at the front desk didn't seem to care either, acting like it wasn't their problem. We asked for the 2 extra beach chairs as a sign of goodwill, and they refused. Two nights later, the same thing happened at 3am. Instead of racing downstairs, we stayed put to see if the alarm went off, which it did after about 4 minutes (talk about the boy who cried wolf). Again, we went down the next morning to talk to the people at the front desk, and again they were nasty and uncaring about the matter. 

Overall, the hotel is great, but I would not recommend this hotel to friends or family until they have the fire alarm situation worked out. Until they do, they should work on their customer service skills....people would feel a lot better about getting lurched out of bed in the middle of the night, if they felt like they were getting apologized to, and some sign of goodwill. Maybe they could have thrown us 2 extra beach chairs and my review would have been a 4/5? Who knows",6.0,Laura G,2014-06-05,,Group,7.4,1201

I upgraded to a standard one bedroom suite which was a very nice apartment style setup with modern contemporary decor. You have a separate bedroom, 2 separate toilets, a large shower and a lounge/diner/kitchen. I was on the 5th floor but on the street side so VERY noisy!

Bedroom:
It was clean, large windows with a street view, tv, excellent blackout curtains. BUT, the room had few snags. The smoke alarm was missing and not replaced, the sliding door wouldn't close, the bed showed signs of wear and tear but top of the ""snag"" list, the bed had a plank of wood under it which made you roll off towards the end of the bed!?

Kitchen 
Self contained and a large fridge so I stocked up on water. Didn't use the appliances so can't really comment. 

Bathroom:
Nice showeroom. Large vanity unity. No problems here.

Lounge
Nice. Again. Nothing wow but just.

Location
Excellent. Stones throw away from the beach, and you have a roof top pool. As you do have a fridge, if you're trying to spend less on your vacation, I'd say pop to Walgreens (2 blocks away) and buy what food/drink you need. As always the mini bar is extortionate! (But that's like every hotel).

But this time, I noticed absolutely no maintenance is going into the property.  My most recent room had paint stained bathroom floor, a couple ripped towels and a tub faucet missing.  This was in addition to a stained bottom sheet for the bed.   The shower lacks a place for soap and management never seems to put bar soap in the shower or bathroom.  The pool area appears nice, but with closer inspection, I noticed dirty canopies, wood decking that requires treatment and lounge chairs that are stained & filthy.  We covered them with the stained pool towels they provided.  It was mid February, and the pool was not heated (pool probably 70 degrees).   Maybe they are trying to save a few bucks?  Lastly, when asked to stay a few extra hours as we had an evening flight, management was less then accommodating.  Historically, they were willing to offer a few extra hours complimentary, but no longer.  11am check out.   It was a fight to even get a noon checkout.   Most other hotels on South Beach will work with a guest if there are available rooms and a good customer.  There were at least 4 rooms available on this sunday when we were checking out.

Hotel currently does not have their own restaurant and restaurant associated with them St. Charles has horrible service. (don't buy breakfast included with your room) go eat down the street at Catalina...fabulous food, casual and great service. Room service does not open until 8am so if you want coffee no go (rooms do not have coffee makers). Beach access -need to get towels and card from front desk - complimentary but chairs are back from ocean (front section of beach is another hotel).  Hotel provides no food and beverage at the beach but you can buy from the Setai hotel beach attendants ($1000  a night hotel!) (good food/drink but not cheap). Roof top pool is nice and staff are great up there.  Hotel seem to have an issue daily of running out of towels. They need to buy more.  No nightly turn down service. (if you care to know). Rooms also have washer and dryer and 2 bathrooms (large bathroom and one two piece). AGain nice benefit for families.",6.0,CPineo,2014-02-23,,Family,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I initially made a reservation for this beautiful property; however, after reading several reviews I noted that there were several complaints regarding their customer service. I decided to take my business elsewhere based on these reviews. A week after I canceled the reservation I found that I was still charged $584. When I contacted the hotel to discuss this the lady placed me on hold, honestly, for 15 min only to return by saying that ""This is just the front desk, I can't help you, you need to email reservations@thinkhotelgrp.com and someone will get back to you."" Not excited about this I informed her that I wanted to speak to a representative and a contact phone number. She quickly stated that this wasn't possible and the only option I have is to email ""thinkhotelgrp"". If this is any indication of their idea of customer service, I'm glad I will not be staying at the hotel. Now I wait to hear back from my email and who knows how long until I see my charges corrected.",2.0,Chris R,2014-03-13,,Solo,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"My friends and I were looking for place that was not right in the middle of all of the nightlife but within walking distance to restaurants, shopping and the beach.  The Boulan was perfect for us.  The property used to be apartments and is now run as a hotel but the units are privately owned.  Our only complaint was my friend wanted coffee each morning and although the description online listed a coffee maker in the amenities provided there was not one.  After asking a few times they did finally provide one but we had to get filters.  There were no utensils, dishes etc. but the rooms were very large which is very hard to find in South Beach and it was very clean with exceptional staff and housekeeping and we will definitely be back.  The pool is on the roof and there was an attendant which was very nice and chairs with umbrella are provided on the nearby beach.  There were some issues with the elevator which was annoying, but we did really enjoy our stay.",8.0,Amy M,2014-03-20,,Group,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"THE GOOD: Very large room, service was ok, great location.  Nice pool area with big comfy beds.  Nice, big, modern bathroom.

NOT SO GOOD: No proper lobby, bar or restaurant, so it feels like you're walking into a motel.  Décor is outdated.  The terrace was unusable - very scruffy with tatty furniture and a pile of cigarette butts.  Breakfast is at a restaurant round the corner where the service is pretty poor and they only open 8-10; tough if you have a morning flight.

BAD: they charge a daily $30 ""Service Fee"" which covers use of the pool (!), WiFi (which is unreliable) and the ""beach club"" (2 tatty loungers and a rusty umbrella).  You pay this no matter what time you arrive at the hotel.  We arrived at 5pm so couldn't use the beach or pool but were still charged.  When I questioned it the clerk blamed Expedia.  Hmm.

There are better hotels in the area for the same price and I wouldn't stay at the Boulan again.",4.0,StewartW96653,2014-03-22,,Family,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"I booked Boulan having never been to South Beach before and essentially did it because of it's vicinity to the beach (1 minute walk.) It can be pricey depending on your budget but if money is your concern South Beach may not be the area to stay. When my fiance and I checked in Olivia at the front desk was so nice and helpful. We got our keys and went to our room. Now this may sound bad but there must have been some lag between check out and cleaning, but our room was not tended to. Suffice it to say, I was not happy. I went down to talk to Olivia at the front desk and she was clearly aghast. She immediately, and without question, upgraded us to another room with a better view of the ocean and was very apologetic. The room was AMAZING. Very clean, full kitchen, 2 TV's and a large couch and a great view of Collins Ave. What could have been an issue was quickly averted. Our stay was so pleasant through and through. Alex was working the front desk for the next couple of days we were there and she was always there with a smile and helpful advice as to what your average ""tourist"" should do in the area. I would recommend Boulan to anyone who asks.",10.0,Peter E,2014-04-07,,Couple,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"They don't offer what they promise on their website. We were 4 friends, we did not get the room we booked. The costumer service was very bad, they charged things on the bill that we did not use from the room bar. There is no compliment tea/coffee in the room, you have to pay for that too.  
They give one card for the beach when you have four people staying in a room, do other two are expected to pay every day. Same with breakfast two per room when you have four people staying in the room. 
The breakfast they include is a joke, it's a tiny portion, not even enough for a kid, it's actually insulting. The restaurant, orange blossom, bad service, little portions, expensive. The drinks we ordered, the glasses had a layer of dirt/ dust at the bottom, of the the waiters dropped silverware on the floor, he just picked them up and gave it to people, no washing them , nothing. 
We did talk to the general manager, he did try to fix a few things but not to our satisfaction. 
In all, not a great experience, will not go back again ever.",2.0,Monikafun,2014-04-08,,,7.4,1201
tripadvisor,"I would really give this place 0 stars if I could !!! 
I book 3 rooms with the hotel for a birthday weekend. I explained to the host I wanted the best room available and as we check in the host notifies us that we have arrived before the rooms are ready, and they won't be ready til 4. Ok , no problem we left and did some shopping and arrived back at the hotel at 4 and the host explains she needs another 20/30 minutes, so to kill time we grab a bite to eat. 

We arrive back at the hotel and we're told the room is ready. Everyone is taken to their rooms and as the bellman takes us to our room with our bags. We open the door to a DIRTY ROOM!!!! The bed is undone there is garbage on the counter, the tv is on and the room is clearly not clean. We had been waiting for hours for a clean room to be brought to a dirty room. Them the bellman is constantly paging the host to inform her (might I add there is only 1 bellman)that he leaves us to go downstairs to grab new keys. THEY LEFT US IN THE DIRTY ROOM WITH OUR STUFF!!!!!

The bellman then takes us to the penthouse floor to a room that was not as nice as the first room although it was dirty and could not accommodate us. We stayed at the hotel a couple of days.we spent sometime at the pool and placed a order poolside and the woman forgot to bring our order. 

Then our room was never cleaned during our stay. I constantly called down to the front desk and nothing until I grabbed the housekeeper myself when I noticed her on her floor asking if she could please clean our room.Such a shame we had to wait to get our room cleaned til the day we left.the Boulan is a nice hotel with great artwork and even a new club Amore attached but the service is HORRIBLE!!! What is even more upsetting there us nothing that the hotel would do for the inconvenience, the young woman said she would email me and she could take off valet parking valet parking is 30bucks she can't be serious. 

This hotel must not care about their business nor their customers and experiences. Several people have left reviews about bad experiences and unlike other pages no one has responded to make things right with their customers. If they keep this up they will not be in business much longer.",2.0,Sharelle B,2014-04-13,,,7.4,1201

The room was extremely clean and roomy.  The bathroom was amazing and large. The location was good.  The pool was clean, but not great.  That didn't really matter though because we went to the beach most of the time.  The only negative thing I have to say is don't eat at the Orange Blossom, which is where you get the complimentary breakfast each day.  We ate there once and the service was soooo bad and it took sooooo long that we never ate there again.  All in all I would definitely stay here again.",10.0,Dianne P,2014-04-14,,Family,7.4,1201

I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff, all of whom were very accommodating to any and all of my requests! The artwork in the hotel is awesome, the rooms are SUPER clean and tidy. And, not to mention the hotel is in a great location/neighborhood! My friends and I had a great time laying out at the pool, which was very hip/chill.

tripadvisor,"Great location, rooms were fantastic, great views, close to everything, very cool vibe, pool was small but super nice and very clean, beach was close, umbrellas and chairs were great.  I gave it four stars overall.  The service was very attentive but sometimes they didn't have the tools to help, I didn't check-in till until 4:30pm, while they were very helpful (we spent the time at the beach and they stored our luggage) it was a late check-in.  They did run out of towels to take to the beach a couple of times and we were told 20 minutes or just take the towels from our room (it had no impact on our time) We did ask for help with the Dish TV and they responded in 5 minutes, although they could not get it to work.  I give the service a 5, I give the hotels ability to give the service the tools to help a 2.  This is South Beach, there is a lot of construction, including the place next to Boulan, not their fault and will be remedied by the time you read this review but be prepared for South Beach construction.  I gave value a 2 but then again, value and South Beach are a bit like oil and water.  We had a great time, I will go again, rooms feels like  you are a high roller in South Beach with great bars and clubs close by.  Worth the trip",8.0,GDP50,2014-04-21,,Group,7.4,1201

tripadvisor,"Beach seats and umbrellas advertised on the website do not exists, you get rusty old seats far away from the sea front on the beach behind other hotel seats!Not the nice seats they show on the website.
2) Cleanliness was an extremely bad standard as there was diarrhea splashed all over the walls and rubbish bin in the toilet from previous guest. Floors haven't been swept or mopped for 4 days while we were there as we spilt a bag of chips on the floor and they hadn't been removed.The bottom sheets on the bed were not changed for 3 days and the cutlery and plates were not cleaned as there was still food stuck on them.The dining/coffee table was not cleaned for the first 5 days.The tumble dryer when we arrived had chewing gum all over the drum which my wife spent 3 hrs trying to remove after the cleaner failed to remove it after we complained.
3) There were 6 lights not working and on the 3rd day of our stay they fixed 3 of them and after many complaints the further 3 were fixed halfway into our stay.
4) This apartment was advertised as fully kitted kitchen.  WHAT  a joke as there wasn't even a kettle or plates for cereal, 2 pans with burnt bottoms,no knives no chopping boards the list goes on. To say this apartment has a fully fitted kitchen is a understatement!
Breakfast was meant to be included in the price but found out we had to pay for it when we got to the restaurant which is detached from the hotel!!!!
5) Spa pool by the main pool  wasn't working the whole time we were there and was never any towels available by the pool as there was never any staff around for longer than 5 minutes to help out.
6) We paid $850 per night including tax for 2 adults and a 10 month baby. We have stayed in alot of luxury  hotels and accommodations around the world and this one i can only give 3 stars and the value should only be $400 per night maximum.
